<h1>MODERN MYTHOLOGY</h1>
<h2>DEDICATION</h2>
<p>Dedicated to the memory of John Fergus McLennan.</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>It may well be doubted whether works of controversy serve any useful
purpose.&nbsp; &lsquo;On an opponent,&rsquo; as Mr. Matthew Arnold said,
&lsquo;one never does make any impression,&rsquo; though one may hope
that controversy sometimes illuminates a topic in the eyes of impartial
readers.&nbsp; The pages which follow cannot but seem wandering and
desultory, for they are a reply to a book, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
<i>Contributions</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>Science</i> <i>of</i> <i>Mythology</i>,
in which the attack is of a skirmishing character.&nbsp; Throughout
more than eight hundred pages the learned author keeps up an irregular
fire at the ideas and methods of the anthropological school of mythologists.&nbsp;
The reply must follow the lines of attack.</p>
<p>Criticism cannot dictate to an author how he shall write his own
book.&nbsp; Yet anthropologists and folk-lorists, &lsquo;agriologists&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Hottentotic&rsquo; students, must regret that Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
did not state their general theory, as he understands it, fully and
once for all.&nbsp; Adversaries rarely succeed in quite understanding
each other; but had Mr. Max M&uuml;ller made such a statement, we could
have cleared up anything in our position which might seem to him obscure.</p>
<p>Our system is but one aspect of the theory of evolution, or is but
the application of that theory to the topic of mythology.&nbsp; The
arch&aelig;ologist studies human life in its material remains; he tracks
progress (and occasional degeneration) from the rudely chipped flints
in the ancient gravel beds, to the polished stone weapon, and thence
to the ages of bronze and iron.&nbsp; He is guided by material &lsquo;survivals&rsquo;&mdash;ancient
arms, implements, and ornaments.&nbsp; The student of Institutions has
a similar method.&nbsp; He finds his relics of the uncivilised past
in agricultural usages, in archaic methods of allotment of land, in
odd marriage customs, things rudimentary&mdash;fossil relics, as it
were, of an early social and political condition.&nbsp; The arch&aelig;ologist
and the student of Institutions compare these relics, material or customary,
with the weapons, pottery, implements, or again with the habitual law
and usage of existing savage or barbaric races, and demonstrate that
our weapons and tools, and our laws and manners, have been slowly evolved
out of lower conditions, even out of savage conditions.</p>
<p>The anthropological method in mythology is the same.&nbsp; In civilised
religion and myth we find rudimentary survivals, fossils of rite and
creed, ideas absolutely incongruous with the environing morality, philosophy,
and science of Greece and India.&nbsp; Parallels to these things, so
out of keeping with civilisation, we recognise in the creeds and rites
of the lower races, even of cannibals; but <i>there</i> the creeds and
rites are <i>not</i> incongruous with their environment of knowledge
and culture.&nbsp; There they are as natural and inevitable as the flint-headed
spear or marriage by capture.&nbsp; We argue, therefore, that religions
and mythical faiths and rituals which, among Greeks and Indians, are
inexplicably incongruous have lived on from an age in which they were
natural and inevitable, an age of savagery.</p>
<p>That is our general position, and it would have been a benefit to
us if Mr. Max M&uuml;ller had stated it in his own luminous way, if
he wished to oppose us, and had shown us where and how it fails to meet
the requirements of scientific method.&nbsp; In place of doing this
once for all, he often assails our evidence, yet never notices the defences
of our evidence, which our school has been offering for over a hundred
years.&nbsp; He attacks the excesses of which some sweet anthropological
enthusiasts have been guilty or may be guilty, such as seeing totems
wherever they find beasts in ancient religion, myth, or art.&nbsp; He
asks for definitions (as of totemism), but never, I think, alludes to
the authoritative definitions by Mr. McLennan and Mr. Frazer.&nbsp;
He assails the theory of fetishism as if it stood now where De Brosses
left it in a purely pioneer work&mdash;or, rather, where he understands
De Brosses to have left it.&nbsp; One might as well attack the atomic
theory where Lucretius left it, or the theory of evolution where it
was left by the elder Darwin.</p>
<p>Thus Mr. Max M&uuml;ller really never conies to grips with his opponents,
and his large volumes shine rather in erudition and style than in method
and system.&nbsp; Anyone who attempts a reply must necessarily follow
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller up and down, collecting his scattered remarks on
this or that point at issue.&nbsp; Hence my reply, much against my will,
must seem desultory and rambling.&nbsp; But I have endeavoured to answer
with some kind of method and system, and I even hope that this little
book may be useful as a kind of supplement to Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s,
for it contains exact references to certain works of which he takes
the reader&rsquo;s knowledge for granted.</p>
<p>The general problem at issue is apt to be lost sight of in this guerilla
kind of warfare.&nbsp; It is perhaps more distinctly stated in the preface
to Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s <i>Chips</i> <i>from</i> <i>a</i> <i>German</i>
<i>Workshop</i>, vol. iv. (Longmans, 1895), than in his two recent volumes.&nbsp;
The general problem is this: Has language&mdash;especially language
in a state of &lsquo;disease,&rsquo; been the great source of the mythology
of the world?&nbsp; Or does mythology, on the whole, represent the survival
of an old stage of thought&mdash;not caused by language&mdash;from which
civilised men have slowly emancipated themselves?&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
is of the former, anthropologists are of the latter, opinion.&nbsp;
Both, of course, agree that myths are a product of thought, of a kind
of thought almost extinct in civilised races; but Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
holds that language caused that kind of thought.&nbsp; We, on the other
hand, think that language only gave it one means of expressing itself.</p>
<p>The essence of myth, as of fairy tale, we agree, is the conception
of the things in the world as all alike animated, personal, capable
of endless interchanges of form.&nbsp; Men may become beasts; beasts
may change into men; gods may appear as human or bestial; stones, plants,
winds, water, may speak and act like human beings, and change shapes
with them.</p>
<p>Anthropologists demonstrate that the belief in this universal kinship,
universal personality of things, which we find surviving only in the
myths of civilised races, is even now to some degree part of the living
creed of savages.&nbsp; Civilised myths, then, they urge, are survivals
from a parallel state of belief once prevalent among the ancestors of
even the Aryan race.&nbsp; But how did this mental condition, this early
sort of false metaphysics, come into existence?&nbsp; We have no direct
historical information on the subject.&nbsp; If I were obliged to offer
an hypothesis, it would be that early men, conscious of personality,
will, and life&mdash;conscious that force, when exerted by themselves,
followed on a determination of will within them&mdash;extended that
explanation to all the exhibitions of force which they beheld without
them.&nbsp; Rivers run (early man thought), winds blow, fire burns,
trees wave, as a result of their own will, the will of personal conscious
entities.&nbsp; Such vitality, and even power of motion, early man attributed
even to inorganic matter, as rocks and stones.&nbsp; All these things
were beings, like man himself.&nbsp; This does not appear to me an unnatural
kind of nascent, half-conscious metaphysics.&nbsp; &lsquo;Man never
knows how much he anthropomorphises.&rsquo;&nbsp; He extended the only
explanation of his own action which consciousness yielded to him, he
extended it to explain every other sort of action in the sensible world.&nbsp;
Early Greek philosophy recognised the stars as living bodies; all things
had once seemed living and personal.&nbsp; From the beginning, man was
eager <i>causas</i> <i>cognoscere</i> <i>rerum</i>.&nbsp; The only cause
about which self-consciousness gave him any knowledge was his own personal
will.&nbsp; He therefore supposed all things to be animated with a like
will and personality.&nbsp; His mythology is a philosophy of things,
stated in stories based on the belief in universal personality.</p>
<p>My theory of the origin of that belief is, of course, a mere guess;
we have never seen any race in the process of passing from a total lack
of a hypothesis of causes into that hypothesis of universally distributed
personality which is the basis of mythology.</p>
<p>But Mr. Max M&uuml;ller conceives that this belief in universally
distributed personality (the word &lsquo;Animism&rsquo; is not very
clear) was the result of an historical necessity&mdash;not of speculation,
but of language. &lsquo;Roots were all, or nearly all, expressive of
action. . . .&nbsp; Hence a river could only be called or conceived
as a runner, or a roarer, or a defender; and in all these capacities
always as something active and animated, nay, as something masculine
or feminine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But <i>why</i> conceived as &lsquo;masculine or feminine&rsquo;?&nbsp;
This necessity for endowing inanimate though active things, such as
rivers, with sex, is obviously a necessity of a stage of thought wholly
unlike our own.&nbsp; <i>We</i> know that active inanimate things are
sexless, are neuter; <i>we</i> feel no necessity to speak of them as
male or female.&nbsp; How did the first speakers of the human race come
to be obliged to call lifeless things by names connoting sex, and therefore
connoting, not only activity, but also life and personality?&nbsp; We
explain it by the theory that man called lifeless things male or female&mdash;by
using gender-terminations&mdash;as a result of his habit of regarding
lifeless things as personal beings; that habit, again, being the result
of his consciousness of himself as a living will.</p>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller takes the opposite view.&nbsp; Man did not call
lifeless things by names denoting sex because he regarded them as persons;
he came to regard them as persons because he had already given them
names connoting sex.&nbsp; And why had he done that?&nbsp; This is what
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller does not explain.&nbsp; He says:</p>
<p>&lsquo;In ancient languages every one of these words&rsquo; (sky,
earth, sea, rain) &lsquo;had necessarily&rsquo; (why necessarily?) &lsquo;a
termination expressive of gender, and this naturally produced in the
mind the corresponding idea of sex, so that these names received not
only an individual but a sexual character.&rsquo;&nbsp; <a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a">{0a}</a></p>
<p>It is curious that, in proof apparently of this, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
cites a passage from the <i>Printer&rsquo;s</i> <i>Register</i>, in
which we read that to little children &lsquo;<i>everything</i> is <i>alive</i>.
. . .&nbsp; The same instinct that prompts the child to personify everything
remains unchecked in the savage, and grows up with him to manhood.&nbsp;
Hence in all simple and early languages there are but two genders, masculine
and feminine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Printer&rsquo;s</i> <i>Register</i> states our theory in its
own words.&nbsp; First came the childlike and savage belief in universal
personality.&nbsp; Thence arose the genders, masculine and feminine,
in early languages.&nbsp; These ideas are the precise reverse of Mr.
Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s ideas.&nbsp; In his opinion, genders in language
caused the belief in the universal personality even of inanimate things.&nbsp;
The <i>Printer&rsquo;s</i> <i>Register</i> holds that the belief in
universal personality, on the other hand, caused the genders.&nbsp;
Yet for thirty years, since 1868, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller has been citing
his direct adversary, in the <i>Printer&rsquo;s</i> <i>Register</i>,
as a supporter of his opinion!&nbsp; We, then, hold that man thought
all things animated, and expressed his belief in gender-terminations.&nbsp;
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller holds that, because man used gender-terminations,
therefore he thought all things animated, and so he became mythop&oelig;ic.&nbsp;
In the passage cited, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller does not say <i>why</i> &lsquo;in
ancient languages every one of these words had <i>necessarily</i> terminations
expressive of gender.&rsquo;&nbsp; He merely quotes the hypothesis of
the <i>Printer&rsquo;s</i> <i>Register</i>.&nbsp; If he accepts that
hypothesis, it destroys his own theory&mdash;that gender-terminations
caused all things to be regarded as personal; for, <i>ex</i> <i>hypothesi</i>,
it was just because they were regarded as personal that they received
names with gender-terminations.&nbsp; Somewhere&mdash;I cannot find
the reference&mdash;Mr. Max M&uuml;ller seems to admit that personalising
thought caused gender-terminations, but these later &lsquo;reacted&rsquo;
on thought, an hypothesis which multiplies causes <i>pr&aelig;ter</i>
<i>necessitatem</i>.</p>
<p>Here, then, at the very threshold of the science of mythology we
find Mr. Max M&uuml;ller at once maintaining that a feature of language,
gender-terminations, caused the mythop&oelig;ic state of thought, and
quoting with approval the statement that the mythop&oelig;ic state of
thought caused gender-terminations.</p>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s whole system of mythology is based on
reasoning analogous to this example.&nbsp; His <i>mot</i> <i>d&rsquo;ordre</i>,
as Professor Tiele says, is &lsquo;a disease of language.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This theory implies universal human degradation.&nbsp; Man was once,
for all we know, rational enough; but his mysterious habit of using
gender-terminations, and his perpetual misconceptions of the meaning
of old words in his own language, reduced him to the irrational and
often (as we now say) obscene and revolting absurdities of his myths.&nbsp;
Here (as is later pointed out) the objection arises, that all languages
must have taken the disease in the same way.&nbsp; A Maori myth is very
like a Greek myth.&nbsp; If the Greek myth arose from a disease of Greek,
how did the wholly different Maori speech, and a score of others, come
to have precisely the same malady?</p>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller alludes to a Maori parallel to the myth of Cronos.
<a name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b">{0b}</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;We
can only say that there is a rusty lock in New Zealand, and a rusty
lock in Greece, and that, surely, is very small comfort.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He does not take the point.&nbsp; The point is that, as the myth occurs
in two remote and absolutely unconnected languages, a theory of disease
of language cannot turn the wards of the rusty locks.&nbsp; The myth
is, in part at least, a nature-myth&mdash;an attempt to account for
the severance of Heaven and Earth (once united) by telling a story in
which natural phenomena are animated and personal.&nbsp; A disease of
language has nothing to do with this myth.&nbsp; It is cited as a proof
against the theory of disease of language.</p>
<p>The truth is, that while languages differ, men (and above all early
men) have the same kind of thoughts, desires, fancies, habits, institutions.&nbsp;
It is not that in which all races formally differ&mdash;their language&mdash;but
that in which all early races are astonishingly the same&mdash;their
ideas, fancies, habits, desires&mdash;that causes the amazing similarity
of their myths.</p>
<p>Mythologists, then, who find in early human nature the living ideas
which express themselves in myths will hardily venture to compare the
analogous myths of all peoples.&nbsp; Mythologists, on the other hand,
who find the origin of myths in a necessity imposed upon thought by
misunderstood language will necessarily, and logically, compare only
myths current among races who speak languages of the same family.&nbsp;
Thus, throughout Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s new book we constantly
find him protesting, on the whole and as a rule, against the system
which illustrates Aryan myths by savage parallels.&nbsp; Thus he maintains
that it is perilous to make comparative use of myths current in languages&mdash;say,
Maori or Samoyed&mdash;which the mythologists confessedly do not know.&nbsp;
To this we can only reply that we use the works of the best accessible
authorities, men who do know the languages&mdash;say, Dr. Codrington
or Bishop Callaway, or Castren or Egede.&nbsp; Now it is not maintained
that the myths, on the whole, are incorrectly translated.&nbsp; The
danger which we incur, it seems, is ignorance of the original sense
of savage or barbaric divine or heroic names&mdash;say, Maui, or Yehl,
or Huitzilopochhtli, or Heitsi Eibib, or Pundjel.&nbsp; By Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
system such names are old words, of meanings long ago generally lost
by the speakers of each language, but analysable by &lsquo;true scholars&rsquo;
into their original significance.&nbsp; That will usually be found by
the philologists to indicate &lsquo;the inevitable Dawn,&rsquo; or Sun,
or Night, or the like, according to the taste and fancy of the student.</p>
<p>To all this a reply is urged in the following pages.&nbsp; In agreement
with Curtius and many other scholars, we very sincerely doubt almost
all etymologies of old proper names, even in Greek or Sanskrit.&nbsp;
We find among philologists, as a rule, the widest discrepancies of interpretation.&nbsp;
Moreover, every name must mean <i>something</i>.&nbsp; Now, whatever
the meaning of a name (supposing it to be really ascertained), very
little ingenuity is needed to make it indicate one or other aspect of
Dawn or Night, of Lightning or Storm, just as the philologist pleases.&nbsp;
Then he explains the divine or heroic being denoted by the name&mdash;as
Dawn or Storm, or Fire or Night, or Twilight or Wind&mdash;in accordance
with his private taste, easily accommodating the facts of the myth,
whatever they may be, to his favourite solution.&nbsp; We rebel against
this kind of logic, and persist in studying the myth in itself and in
comparison with analogous myths in every accessible language.&nbsp;
Certainly, if divine and heroic names&mdash;Artemis or Pundjel&mdash;<i>can</i>
be interpreted, so much is gained.&nbsp; But the myth may be older than
the name.</p>
<p>As Mr. Hogarth points out, Alexander has inherited in the remote
East the myths of early legendary heroes.&nbsp; We cannot explain these
by the analysis of the name of Alexander!&nbsp; Even if the heroic or
divine name can be shown to be the original one (which is practically
impossible), the meaning of the name helps us little.&nbsp; That Zeus
means &lsquo;sky&rsquo; cannot conceivably explain scores of details
in the very composite legend of Zeus&mdash;say, the story of Zeus, Demeter,
and the Ram.&nbsp; Moreover, we decline to admit that, if a divine name
means &lsquo;swift,&rsquo; its bearer must be the wind or the sunlight.&nbsp;
Nor, if the name means &lsquo;white,&rsquo; is it necessarily a synonym
of Dawn, or of Lightning, or of Clear Air, or what not.&nbsp; But a
mythologist who makes language and names the fountain of myth will go
on insisting that myths can only be studied by people who know the language
in which they are told.&nbsp; Mythologists who believe that human nature
is the source of myths will go on comparing all myths that are accessible
in translations by competent collectors.</p>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller says, &lsquo;We seldom find mythology, as it
were, <i>in</i> <i>situ</i>&mdash;as it lived in the minds and unrestrained
utterances of the people.&nbsp; We generally have to study it in the
works of mythographers, or in the poems of later generations, when it
had long ceased to be living and intelligible.&rsquo;&nbsp; The myths
of Greece and Rome, in Hyginus or Ovid, &lsquo;are likely to be as misleading
as a <i>hortus</i> <i>siccus</i> would be to a botanist if debarred
from his rambles through meadows and hedges.&rsquo; <a name="citation0c"></a><a href="#footnote0c">{0c}</a></p>
<p>Nothing can be more true, or more admirably stated.&nbsp; These remarks
are, indeed, the charter, so to speak, of anthropological mythology
and of folklore.&nbsp; The old mythologists worked at a <i>hortus</i>
<i>siccus</i>, at myths dried and pressed in thoroughly literary books,
Greek and Latin.&nbsp; But we now study myths &lsquo;in the unrestrained
utterances of the people,&rsquo; either of savage tribes or of the European
Folk, the unprogressive peasant class.&nbsp; The former, and to some
extent the latter, still live in the mythop&oelig;ic state of mind&mdash;regarding
bees, for instance, as persons who must be told of a death in the family.&nbsp;
Their myths are still not wholly out of concord with their habitual
view of a world in which an old woman may become a hare.&nbsp; As soon
as learned Jesuits like P&egrave;re Lafitau began to understand their
savage flocks, they said, &lsquo;These men are living in Ovid&rsquo;s
<i>Metamorphoses</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; They found mythology <i>in</i> <i>situ</i>!&nbsp;
Hence mythologists now study mythology <i>in</i> <i>situ</i>&mdash;in
savages and in peasants, who till very recently were still in the mythop&oelig;ic
stage of thought.&nbsp; Mannhardt made this idea his basis.&nbsp; Mr.
Max M&uuml;ller says, <a name="citation0d"></a><a href="#footnote0d">{0d}</a>
very naturally, that I have been &lsquo;popularising the often difficult
and complicated labours of Mannhardt and others.&rsquo;&nbsp; In fact
(as is said later), I published all my general conclusions before I
had read Mannhardt.&nbsp; Quite independently I could not help seeing
that among savages and peasants we had mythology, not in a literary
<i>hortus</i> <i>siccus</i>, but <i>in</i> <i>situ</i>.&nbsp; Mannhardt,
though he appreciated Dr. Tylor, had made, I think, but few original
researches among savage myths and customs.&nbsp; His province was European
folklore.&nbsp; What he missed will be indicated in the chapter on &lsquo;The
Fire-Walk&rsquo;&mdash;one example among many.</p>
<p>But this kind of mythology <i>in</i> <i>situ</i>, in &lsquo;the unrestrained
utterances of the people,&rsquo; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller tells us, is no
province of his.&nbsp; &lsquo;I saw it was hopeless for me to gain a
knowledge at first hand of innumerable local legends and customs;&rsquo;
and it is to be supposed that he distrusted knowledge acquired by collectors:
Grimm, Mannhardt, Campbell of Islay, and an army of others.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
scholarlike knowledge of Maori or Hottentot mythology&rsquo; was also
beyond him.&nbsp; We, on the contrary, take our Maori lore from a host
of collectors: Taylor, White, Manning (&lsquo;The Pakeha Maori&rsquo;),
Tregear, Polack, and many others.&nbsp; From them we flatter ourselves
that we get&mdash;as from Grimm, Mannhardt, Islay, and the rest&mdash;mythology
<i>in</i> <i>situ</i>.&nbsp; We compare it with the dry mythologic blossoms
of the classical <i>hortus</i> <i>siccus</i>, and with Greek ritual
and temple legend, and with <i>M&auml;rchen</i> in the scholiasts, and
we think the comparisons very illuminating.&nbsp; They have thrown new
light on Greek mythology, ritual, mysteries, and religion.&nbsp; This
much we think we have already done, though we do not know Maori, and
though each of us can hope to gather but few facts from the mouths of
living peasants.</p>
<p>Examples of the results of our method will be found in the following
pages.&nbsp; Thus, if the myth of the fire-stealer in Greece is explained
by misunderstood Greek or Sanskrit words in no way connected with robbery,
we shall show that the myth of the theft of fire occurs where no Greek
or Sanskrit words were ever spoken.&nbsp; <i>There</i>, we shall show,
the myth arose from simple inevitable human ideas.&nbsp; We shall therefore
doubt whether in Greece a common human myth had a singular cause&mdash;in
a &lsquo;disease of language.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is with no enthusiasm that I take the opportunity of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
reply to me &lsquo;by name.&rsquo;&nbsp; Since <i>Myth</i>, <i>Ritual</i>,
<i>and</i> <i>Religion</i> (now out of print, but accessible in the
French of M. Marillier) was published, ten years ago, I have left mythology
alone.&nbsp; The general method there adopted has been applied in a
much more erudite work by Mr. Frazer, <i>The</i> <i>Golden</i> <i>Bough</i>,
by Mr. Farnell in <i>Cults</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Greek</i> <i>States</i>,
by Mr. Jevons in his <i>Introduction</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>History</i>
<i>of</i> <i>Religion</i>, by Miss Harrison in explanations of Greek
ritual, by Mr. Hartland in <i>The</i> <i>Legend</i> <i>of</i> <i>Perseus</i>,
and doubtless by many other writers.&nbsp; How much they excel me in
erudition may be seen by comparing Mr. Farnell&rsquo;s passage on the
Bear Artemis <a name="citation0e"></a><a href="#footnote0e">{0e}</a>
with the section on her in this volume.</p>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller observes that &lsquo;Mannhardt&rsquo;s mythological
researches have never been fashionable.&rsquo;&nbsp; They are now very
much in fashion; they greatly inspire Mr. Frazer and Mr. Farnell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They seemed to me, and still seem to me, too exclusive,&rsquo;
says Mr. Max M&uuml;ller. <a name="citation0f"></a><a href="#footnote0f">{0f}</a>&nbsp;
Mannhardt in his second period was indeed chiefly concerned with myths
connected, as he held, with agriculture and with tree-worship.&nbsp;
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, too, has been thought &lsquo;exclusive&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;as
teaching,&rsquo; he complains, &lsquo;that the whole of mythology is
solar.&rsquo;&nbsp; That reproach arose, he says, because &lsquo;some
of my earliest contributions to comparative mythology were devoted exclusively
to the special subject of solar myths.&rsquo; <a name="citation0g"></a><a href="#footnote0g">{0g}</a>&nbsp;
But Mr. Max M&uuml;ller also mentions his own complaints, of &lsquo;the
omnipresent sun and the inevitable dawn appearing in ever so many disguises.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Did they really appear?&nbsp; Were the myths, say the myths of Daphne,
really solar?&nbsp; That is precisely what we hesitate to accept.&nbsp;
In the same way Mannhardt&rsquo;s preoccupation with vegetable myths
has tended, I think, to make many of his followers ascribe vegetable
origins to myths and gods, where the real origin is perhaps for ever
lost.&nbsp; The corn-spirit starts up in most unexpected places.&nbsp;
Mr. Frazer, Mannhardt&rsquo;s disciple, is very severe on solar theories
of Osiris, and connects that god with the corn-spirit.&nbsp; But Mannhardt
did not go so far.&nbsp; Mannhardt thought that the myth of Osiris was
solar.&nbsp; To my thinking, these resolutions of myths into this or
that original source&mdash;solar, nocturnal, vegetable, or what not&mdash;are
often very perilous.&nbsp; A myth so extremely composite as that of
Osiris must be a stream flowing from many springs, and, as in the case
of certain rivers, it is difficult or impossible to say which is the
real fountain-head.</p>
<p>One would respectfully recommend to young mythologists great reserve
in their hypotheses of origins.&nbsp; All this, of course, is the familiar
thought of writers like Mr. Frazer and Mr. Farnell, but a tendency to
seek for exclusively vegetable origins of gods is to be observed in
some of the most recent speculations.&nbsp; I well know that I myself
am apt to press a theory of totems too far, and in the following pages
I suggest reserves, limitations, and alternative hypotheses.&nbsp; <i>Il</i>
<i>y</i> <i>a</i> <i>serpent</i> <i>et</i> <i>serpent</i>; a snake tribe
may be a local tribe named from the Snake River, not a totem kindred.&nbsp;
The history of mythology is the history of rash, premature, and exclusive
theories.&nbsp; We are only beginning to learn caution.&nbsp; Even the
prevalent anthropological theory of the ghost-origin of religion might,
I think, be advanced with caution (as Mr. Jevons argues on other grounds)
till we know a little more about ghosts and a great deal more about
psychology.&nbsp; We are too apt to argue as if the psychical condition
of the earliest men were exactly like our own; while we are just beginning
to learn, from Prof. William James, that about even our own psychical
condition we are only now realising our exhaustive ignorance.&nbsp;
How often we men have thought certain problems settled for good!&nbsp;
How often we have been compelled humbly to return to our studies!&nbsp;
Philological comparative mythology seemed securely seated for a generation.&nbsp;
Her throne is tottering:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our little systems have their day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They have their day and cease to be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They are but broken lights from Thee,<br />
And Thou, we trust, art more than they.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we need not hate each other for the sake of our little systems,
like the grammarian who damned his rival&rsquo;s soul for his &lsquo;theory
of the irregular verbs.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nothing, I hope, is said here inconsistent
with the highest esteem for Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s vast erudition,
his enviable style, his unequalled contributions to scholarship, and
his awakening of that interest in mythological science without which
his adversaries would probably never have existed.</p>
<p>Most of Chapter XII. appeared in the &lsquo;Contemporary Review,&rsquo;
and most of Chapter XIII. in the &lsquo;Princeton Review.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>REGENT MYTHOLOGY</h2>
<h3>Mythology in 1860-1880</h3>
<p>Between 1860 and 1880, roughly speaking, English people interested
in early myths and religions found the mythological theories of Professor
Max M&uuml;ller in possession of the field.&nbsp; These brilliant and
attractive theories, taking them in the widest sense, were not, of course,
peculiar to the Right Hon. Professor.&nbsp; In France, in Germany, in
America, in Italy, many scholars agreed in his opinion that the science
of language is the most potent spell for opening the secret chamber
of mythology.&nbsp; But while these scholars worked on the same general
principle as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, while they subjected the names of
mythical beings&mdash;Zeus, Helen, Achilles, Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc;&mdash;to
philological analysis, and then explained the stories of gods and heroes
by their interpretations of the meanings of their names, they arrived
at all sorts of discordant results.&nbsp; Where Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
found a myth of the Sun or of the Dawn, these scholars were apt to see
a myth of the wind, of the lightning, of the thunder-cloud, of the <i>cr&eacute;puscule</i>,
of the upper air, of what each of them pleased.&nbsp; But these ideas&mdash;the
ideas of Kuhn, Welcker, Curtius (when he appeared in the discussion),
of Schwartz, of Lauer, of Br&eacute;al, of many others&mdash;were very
little known&mdash;if known at all&mdash;to the English public.&nbsp;
Captivated by the graces of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s manner, and
by a style so pellucid that it accredited a logic perhaps not so clear,
the public hardly knew of the divisions in the philological camp.&nbsp;
They were unaware that, as Mannhardt says, the philological school had
won &lsquo;few sure gains,&rsquo; and had discredited their method by
a &lsquo;muster-roll of variegated&rsquo; and discrepant &lsquo;hypotheses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, in all sciences there are differences of opinion about details.&nbsp;
In comparative mythology there was, with rare exceptions, no agreement
at all about results beyond this point; Greek and Sanskrit, German and
Slavonic myths were, in the immense majority of instances, to be regarded
as mirror-pictures on earth, of celestial and meteorological phenomena.&nbsp;
Thus even the story of the Earth Goddess, the Harvest Goddess, Demeter,
was usually explained as a reflection in myth of one or another celestial
phenomenon&mdash;dawn, storm-cloud, or something else according to taste.</p>
<p>Again, Greek or German myths were usually to be interpreted by comparison
with myths in the Rig Veda.&nbsp; Their origin was to be ascertained
by discovering the Aryan root and original significance of the names
of gods and heroes, such as Saranyu&mdash;Erinnys, Daphne&mdash;Dahan&acirc;,
Athene&mdash;Ahan&acirc;.&nbsp; The etymology and meaning of such names
being ascertained, the origin and sense of the myths in which the names
occur should be clear.</p>
<p>Clear it was not.&nbsp; There were, in most cases, as many opinions
as to the etymology and meaning of each name and myth, as there were
philologists engaged in the study.&nbsp; Mannhardt, who began, in 1858,
as a member of the philological school, in his last public utterance
(1877) described the method and results, including his own work of 1858,
as &lsquo;mainly failures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, long ere that, the English cultivated public had, most naturally,
accepted Mr. Max M&uuml;ller as the representative of the school which
then held the field in comparative mythology.&nbsp; His German and other
foreign brethren, with their discrepant results, were only known to
the general, in England (I am not speaking of English scholars), by
the references to them in the Oxford professor&rsquo;s own works.&nbsp;
His theories were made part of the education of children, and found
their way into a kind of popular primers.</p>
<p>For these reasons, anyone in England who was daring enough to doubt,
or to deny, the validity of the philological system of mythology in
general was obliged to choose Mr. Max M&uuml;ller as his adversary.&nbsp;
He must strike, as it were, the shield of no Hospitaler of unsteady
seat, but that of the Templar himself.&nbsp; And this is the cause of
what seems to puzzle Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, namely the attacks on <i>his</i>
system and <i>his</i> results in particular.&nbsp; An English critic,
writing for English readers, had to do with the scholar who chiefly
represented the philological school of mythology in the eyes of England.</p>
<h3>Autobiographical</h3>
<p>Like other inquiring undergraduates in the sixties, I read such works
on mythology as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller had then given to the world; I read
them with interest, but without conviction.&nbsp; The argument, the
logic, seemed to evade one; it was purely, with me, a question of logic,
for I was of course prepared to accept all of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
dicta on questions of etymologies.&nbsp; Even now I never venture to
impugn them, only, as I observe that other scholars very frequently
differ, <i>toto</i> <i>c&aelig;lo</i>, from him and from each other
in essential questions, I preserve a just balance of doubt; I wait till
these gentlemen shall be at one among themselves.</p>
<p>After taking my degree in 1868, I had leisure to read a good deal
of mythology in the legends of all races, and found my distrust of Mr.
Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s reasoning increase upon me.&nbsp; The main cause
was that whereas Mr. Max M&uuml;ller explained Greek myths by etymologies
of words in the Aryan languages, chiefly Greek, Latin, Slavonic, and
Sanskrit, I kept finding myths very closely resembling those of Greece
among Red Indians, Kaffirs, Eskimo, Samoyeds, Kamilaroi, Maoris, and
Cahrocs.&nbsp; Now if Aryan myths arose from a &lsquo;disease&rsquo;
of Aryan languages, it certainly did seem an odd thing that myths so
similar to these abounded where non-Aryan languages alone prevailed.&nbsp;
Did a kind of linguistic measles affect all tongues alike, from Sanskrit
to Choctaw, and everywhere produce the same ugly scars in religion and
myth?</p>
<h3>The Ugly Scars</h3>
<p>The ugly scars were the problem!&nbsp; A civilised fancy is not puzzled
for a moment by a beautiful beneficent Sun-god, or even by his beholding
the daughters of men that they are fair.&nbsp; But a civilised fancy
<i>is</i> puzzled when the beautiful Sun-god makes love in the shape
of a dog. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a>&nbsp;
To me, and indeed to Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, the ugly scars were the problem.</p>
<p>He has written&mdash;&lsquo;What makes mythology mythological, in
the true sense of the word, is what is utterly unintelligible, absurd,
strange, or miraculous.&rsquo;&nbsp; But he explained these blots on
the mythology of Greece, for example, as the result practically of old
words and popular sayings surviving in languages after the original,
harmless, symbolical meanings of the words and sayings were lost.&nbsp;
What had been a poetical remark about an aspect of nature became an
obscene, or brutal, or vulgar myth, a stumbling block to Greek piety
and to Greek philosophy.</p>
<p>To myself, on the other hand, it seemed that the ugly scars were
remains of that kind of taste, fancy, customary law, and incoherent
speculation which everywhere, as far as we know, prevails to various
degrees in savagery and barbarism.&nbsp; Attached to the &lsquo;hideous
idols,&rsquo; as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller calls them, of early Greece, and
implicated in a ritual which religious conservatism dared not abandon,
the fables of perhaps neolithic ancestors of the Hellenes remained in
the religion and the legends known to Plato and Socrates.&nbsp; That
this process of &lsquo;survival&rsquo; is a <i>vera</i> <i>causa</i>,
illustrated in every phase of evolution, perhaps nobody denies.</p>
<p>Thus the phenomena which the philological school of mythology explains
by a disease of language we would explain by survival from a savage
state of society and from the mental peculiarities observed among savages
in all ages and countries.&nbsp; Of course there is nothing new in this:
I was delighted to discover the idea in Eusebius as in Fontenelle; while,
for general application to singular institutions, it was a commonplace
of the last century. <a name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a">{6a}</a>&nbsp;
Moreover, the idea had been widely used by Dr. E. B. Tylor in <i>Primitive</i>
<i>Culture</i>, and by Mr. McLennan in his <i>Primitive</i> <i>Marriage</i>
and essays on Totemism.</p>
<h3>My Criticism of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller</h3>
<p>This idea I set about applying to the repulsive myths of civilised
races, and to <i>M&auml;rchen</i>, or popular tales, at the same time
combating the theories which held the field&mdash;the theories of the
philological mythologists as applied to the same matter.&nbsp; In journalism
I criticised Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, and I admit that, when comparing the
mutually destructive competition of varying etymologies, I did not abstain
from the weapons of irony and <i>badinage</i>.&nbsp; The opportunity
was too tempting!&nbsp; But, in the most sober seriousness, I examined
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s general statement of his system, his hypothesis
of certain successive stages of language, leading up to the mythop&oelig;ic
confusion of thought.&nbsp; It was not a question of denying Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s etymologies, but of asking whether he established
his historical theory by evidence, and whether his inferences from it
were logically deduced.&nbsp; The results of my examination will be
found in the article &lsquo;Mythology&rsquo; in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>
<i>Britannica</i>, and in <i>La</i> <i>Mythologie</i>. <a name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b">{6b}</a>&nbsp;
It did not appear to me that Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s general theory
was valid, logical, historically demonstrated, or self-consistent.&nbsp;
My other writings on the topic are chiefly <i>Custom</i> <i>and</i>
<i>Myth</i>, <i>Myth</i>, <i>Ritual</i>, <i>and</i> <i>Religion</i>
(with French and Dutch translations, both much improved and corrected
by the translators), and an introduction to Mrs. Hunt&rsquo;s translation
of Grimm&rsquo;s <i>M&auml;rchen</i>.</p>
<h3>Success of Anthropological Method</h3>
<p>During fifteen years the ideas which I advocated seem to have had
some measure of success.&nbsp; This is, doubtless, due not to myself,
but to the works of Mr. J. G. Frazer and of Professor Robertson Smith.&nbsp;
Both of these scholars descend intellectually from a man less scholarly
than they, but, perhaps, more original and acute than any of us, my
friend the late Mr. J. F. McLennan.&nbsp; To Mannhardt also much is
owed, and, of course, above all, to Dr. Tylor.&nbsp; These writers,
like Mr. Farnell and Mr. Jevons recently, seek for the answer to mythological
problems rather in the habits and ideas of the folk and of savages and
barbarians than in etymologies and &lsquo;a disease of language.&rsquo;&nbsp;
There are differences of opinion in detail: I myself may think that
&lsquo;vegetation spirits,&rsquo; the &lsquo;corn spirit,&rsquo; and
the rest occupy too much space in the systems of Mannhardt, and other
moderns.&nbsp; Mr. Frazer, again, thinks less of the evidence for Totems
among &lsquo;Aryans&rsquo; than I was inclined to do. <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7">{7}</a>&nbsp;
But it is not, perhaps, an overstatement to say that explanation of
myths by analysis of names, and the lately overpowering predominance
of the Dawn, and the Sun, and the Night in mythological hypothesis,
have received a slight check.&nbsp; They do not hold the field with
the superiority which was theirs in England between 1860 and 1880.&nbsp;
This fact&mdash;a scarcely deniable fact&mdash;does not, of course,
prove that the philological method is wrong, or that the Dawn is not
as great a factor in myth as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller believes himself to
have proved it to be.&nbsp; Science is inevitably subject to shiftings
of opinion, action, and reaction.</p>
<h3>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s Reply</h3>
<p>In this state of things Mr. Max M&uuml;ller produces his <i>Contributions</i>
<i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>Science</i> <i>of</i> <i>Mythology</i>, <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8">{8}</a>
which I propose to criticise as far as it is, or may seem to me to be,
directed against myself, or against others who hold practically much
the same views as mine.&nbsp; I say that I attempt to criticise the
book &lsquo;as far as it is, or may seem to me to be, directed against&rsquo;
us, because it is Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s occasional habit to argue
(apparently) <i>around</i> rather than <i>with</i> his opponents.&nbsp;
He says &lsquo;we are told this or that&rsquo;&mdash;something which
he does not accept&mdash;but he often does not inform us as to <i>who</i>
tells us, or where.&nbsp; Thus a reader does not know whom Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
is opposing, or where he can find the adversary&rsquo;s own statement
in his own words.&nbsp; Yet it is usual in such cases, and it is, I
think, expedient, to give chapter and verse.&nbsp; Occasionally I find
that Mr. Max M&uuml;ller is honouring me by alluding to observations
of my own, but often no reference is given to an opponent&rsquo;s name
or books, and we discover the passages in question by accident or research.&nbsp;
This method will be found to cause certain inconveniences.</p>
<h2>THE STORY OF DAPHNE</h2>
<h3>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s Method in Controversy</h3>
<p>As an illustration of the author&rsquo;s controversial methods, take
his observations on my alleged attempt to account for the metamorphosis
of Daphne into a laurel tree.&nbsp; When I read these remarks (i. p.
4) I said, &lsquo;Mr. Max M&uuml;ller vanquishes me <i>there</i>,&rsquo;
for he gave no reference to my statement.&nbsp; I had forgotten all
about the matter, I was not easily able to find the passage to which
he alluded, and I supposed that I had said just what Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
seemed to me to make me say&mdash;no more, and no less.&nbsp; Thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mr. Lang, as usual, has recourse to savages, most
useful when they are really wanted.&nbsp; He quotes an illustration
from the South Pacific that Tuna, the chief of the eels, fell in love
with Ina and asked her to cut off his head.&nbsp; When his head had
been cut off and buried, two cocoanut trees sprang up from the brain
of Tuna.&nbsp; How is this, may I ask, to account for the story of Daphne?&nbsp;
Everybody knows that &ldquo;stories of the growing of plants out of
the scattered members of heroes may be found from ancient Egypt to the
wigwams of the Algonquins,&rdquo; but these stories seem hardly applicable
to Daphne, whose members, as far as I know, were never either severed
or scattered.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought, perhaps hastily, that I must have made the story of Tuna
&lsquo;account for the story of Daphne.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
does not actually say that I did so, but I understood him in that sense,
and recognised my error.&nbsp; But, some guardian genius warning me,
I actually hunted up my own observations. <a name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a">{10a}</a>&nbsp;
Well, I had never said (as I conceived my critic to imply) that the
story of Tuna &lsquo;accounts for the story of Daphne.&rsquo;&nbsp;
That was what I had not said.&nbsp; I had observed, &lsquo;As to interchange
of shape between men and women and <i>plants</i>, our information, so
far as the lower races are concerned, is less copious&rsquo;&mdash;than
in the case of stones.&nbsp; I then spoke of plant totems of one kin
with human beings, of plant-souls, <a name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b">{10b}</a>
of Indian and Egyptian plants animated by <i>human</i> souls, of a tree
which became a young man and made love to a Yurucari girl, of metamorphosis
into vegetables in Samoa, <a name="citation10c"></a><a href="#footnote10c">{10c}</a>
of an Ottawa myth in which a man became a plant of maize, and then of
the story of Tuna. <a name="citation10d"></a><a href="#footnote10d">{10d}</a>&nbsp;
Next I mentioned plants said to have sprung from dismembered gods and
heroes.&nbsp; <i>All</i> this, I said, <i>all</i> of it, proves that
savages mythically regard human life as on a level with vegetable no
less than with animal life.&nbsp; &lsquo;Turning to the mythology of
Greece, we see that the same rule holds good.&nbsp; Metamorphosis into
plants and flowers is extremely common,&rsquo; and I, of course, attributed
the original idea of such metamorphoses to &lsquo;the general savage
habit of &ldquo;levelling up,&rdquo;&rsquo; of regarding all things
in nature as all capable of interchanging their identities.&nbsp; I
gave, as classical examples, Daphne, Myrrha, Hyacinth, Narcissus, and
the sisters of Phaethon.&nbsp; Next I criticised Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
theory of Daphne.&nbsp; But I never hinted that the isolated Mangaian
story of Tuna, or the stories of plants sprung from mangled men, &lsquo;accounted,&rsquo;
by themselves, &lsquo;for the story of Daphne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller is not content with giving a very elaborate and
interesting account of how the story of Tuna arose (i. 5-7).&nbsp; He
keeps Tuna in hand, and, at the peroration of his vast work (ii. 831),
warns us that, before we compare myths in unrelated languages, we need
&lsquo;a very accurate knowledge of their dialects . . . to prevent
accidents like that of Tuna mentioned in the beginning.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What accident?&nbsp; That I explained the myth of Daphne by the myth
of Tuna?&nbsp; But that is precisely what I did not do.&nbsp; I explained
the Greek myth of Daphne (1) as a survival from the savage mental habit
of regarding men as on a level with stones, beasts, and plants; or (2)
as a tale &lsquo;moulded by poets on the same model.&rsquo; <a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11">{11}</a>&nbsp;
The latter is the more probable case, for we find Daphne late, in artificial
or mythographic literature, in Ovid and Hyginus.&nbsp; In Ovid the river
god, Pentheus, changes Daphne into a laurel.&nbsp; In Hyginus she is
not changed at all; the earth swallows her, and a laurel fills her place.</p>
<p>Now I really did believe&mdash;perhaps any rapid reader would have
believed&mdash;when I read Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, that I must have tried
to account for the story of Daphne by the story of Tuna.&nbsp; I actually
wrote in the first draft of this work that I had been in the wrong.&nbsp;
Then I verified the reference which my critic did not give, with the
result which the reader has perused.&nbsp; Never could a reader have
found out what I did really say from my critic, for he does not usually
when he deals with me give chapter and verse.&nbsp; This may avoid an
air of personal bickering, but how inconvenient it is!</p>
<p>Let me not be supposed to accuse Mr. Max M&uuml;ller of consciously
misrepresenting me.&nbsp; Of that I need not say that he is absolutely
incapable.&nbsp; My argument merely took, in his consciousness, the
form which is suggested in the passage cited from him.</p>
<h3>Tuna and Daphne</h3>
<p>To do justice to Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, I will here state fully his
view of the story of Tuna, and then go on to the story of Daphne.&nbsp;
For the sake of accuracy, I take the liberty of borrowing the whole
of his statement (i. 4-7):&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must dwell a little longer on this passage in order to show
the real difference between the ethnological and the philological schools
of comparative mythology.</p>
<p>&lsquo;First of all, what has to be explained is not the growing
up of a tree from one or the other member of a god or hero, but the
total change of a human being or a heroine into a tree, and this under
a certain provocation.&nbsp; These two classes of plant-legends must
be carefully kept apart.&nbsp; Secondly, what does it help us to know
that people in Mangaia believed in the change of human beings into trees,
if we do not know the reason why?&nbsp; This is what we want to know;
and without it the mere juxtaposition of stories apparently similar
is no more than the old trick of explaining ignotum per ignotius.&nbsp;
It leads us to imagine that we have learnt something, when we really
are as ignorant as before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Mr. A. Lang had studied the Mangaian dialect, or consulted
scholars like the Rev. W. W. Gill&mdash;it is from his &ldquo;Myths
and Songs from the South Pacific&rdquo; that he quotes the story of
Tuna&mdash;he would have seen that there is no similarity whatever between
the stories of Daphne and of Tuna.&nbsp; The Tuna story belongs to a
very well known class of &aelig;tiological plant-stories, which are
meant to explain a no longer intelligible name of a plant, such as Snakeshead,
Stiefm&uuml;tterchen, &amp;c.; it is in fact a clear case of what I
call disease of language, cured by the ordinary nostrum of folk-etymology.&nbsp;
I have often been in communication with the Rev. W. W. Gill about these
South Pacific myths and their true meaning.&nbsp; The preface to his
collection of Myths and Songs from the South Pacific was written by
me in 1876; and if Mr. A. Lang had only read the whole chapter which
treats of these Tree-Myths (p. 77 seq.), he would easily have perceived
the real character of the Tuna story, and would not have placed it in
the same class as the Daphne story; he would have found that the white
kernel of the cocoanut was, in Mangaia, called the &ldquo;brains of
Tuna,&rdquo; a name like many more such names which after a time require
an explanation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Considering that &ldquo;cocoanut&rdquo; was used in Mangaia
in the sense of head (<i>testa</i>), the kernel or flesh of it might
well be called the brain.&nbsp; If then the white kernel had been called
Tuna&rsquo;s brain, we have only to remember that in Mangaia there are
two kinds of cocoanut trees, and we shall then have no difficulty in
understanding why these twin cocoanut trees were said to have sprung
from the two halves of Tuna&rsquo;s brain, one being red in stem, branches,
and fruit, whilst the other was of a deep green.&nbsp; In proof of these
trees being derived from the head of Tuna, we are told that we have
only to break the nut in order to see in the sprouting germ the two
eyes and the mouth of Tuna, the great eel, the lover of Ina.&nbsp; For
a full understanding of this very complicated myth more information
has been supplied by Mr. Gill.&nbsp; Ina means moon; Ina-mae-aitu, the
heroine of our story, means Ina-who-had-a-divine (<i>aitu</i>) lover,
and she was the daughter of Kui, the blind.&nbsp; Tuna means eel, and
in Mangaia it was unlawful for women to eat eels, so that even now,
as Mr. Gill informs me, his converts turn away from this fish with the
utmost disgust.&nbsp; From other stories about the origin of cocoanut
trees, told in the same island, it would appear that the sprouts of
the cocoanut were actually called eels&rsquo; heads, while the skulls
of warriors were called cocoanuts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Taking all these facts together, it is not difficult to imagine
how the story of Tuna&rsquo;s brain grew up; and I am afraid we shall
have to confess that the legend of Tuna throws but little light on the
legend of Daphne or on the etymology of her name.&nbsp; No one would
have a word to say against the general principle that much that is irrational,
absurd, or barbarous in the Veda is a survival of a more primitive mythology
anterior to the Veda.&nbsp; How could it be otherwise?&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Criticism of Tuna and Daphne</h3>
<p>Now (1), as to Daphne, we are not invariably told that hers was a
case of &lsquo;the total change of a heroine into a tree.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In Ovid <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14">{14}</a> she
is thus changed.&nbsp; In Hyginus, on the other hand, the earth swallows
her, and a tree takes her place.&nbsp; All the authorities are late.&nbsp;
Here I cannot but reflect on the scholarly method of Mannhardt, who
would have examined and criticised all the sources for the tale before
trying to explain it.&nbsp; However, Daphne was not mangled; a tree
did not spring from her severed head or scattered limbs.&nbsp; She was
metamorphosed, or was buried in earth, a tree springing up from the
place.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; I think we do know <i>why</i> the people of Mangaia &lsquo;believe
in the change of human beings into trees.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is one among
many examples of the savage sense of the intercommunity of all nature.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Antiquity made its division between man and the world in a very
different sort than do the moderns.&rsquo; <a name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a">{15a}</a>&nbsp;
I illustrate this mental condition fully in <i>M</i>. <i>R</i>. <i>R</i>.
i. 46-56.&nbsp; <i>Why</i> savages adopt the major premise, &lsquo;Human
life is on a level with the life of all nature,&rsquo; philosophers
explain in various ways.&nbsp; Hume regards it as an extension to the
universe of early man&rsquo;s own consciousness of life and personality.&nbsp;
Dr. Tylor thinks that the opinion rests upon &lsquo;a broad philosophy
of nature.&rsquo; <a name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b">{15b}</a>&nbsp;
M. Lef&eacute;bure appeals to psychical phenomena as I show later (see
&lsquo;Fetishism&rsquo;).&nbsp; At all events, the existence of these
savage metaphysics is a demonstrated fact.&nbsp; I established it <a name="citation15c"></a><a href="#footnote15c">{15c}</a>
before invoking it as an explanation of savage belief in metamorphosis.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; &lsquo;The Tuna story belongs to a very well known class
of &aelig;tiological plant-stories&rsquo; (&aelig;tiological: assigning
a cause for the plant, its peculiarities, its name, &amp;c.), &lsquo;which
are meant to explain a no longer intelligible name of a plant, &amp;c.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I also say, &lsquo;these myths are nature-myths, so far as they attempt
to account for a fact in nature&mdash;namely, for the existence of certain
plants, and for their place in ritual.&rsquo; <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16">{16}</a></p>
<p>The reader has before him Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s view.&nbsp;
The white kernel of the cocoanut was locally styled &lsquo;the brains
of Tuna.&rsquo;&nbsp; That name required explanation.&nbsp; Hence the
story about the fate of Tuna.&nbsp; Cocoanut was used in Mangaia in
the sense of &lsquo;head&rsquo; (<i>testa</i>).&nbsp; So it is now in
England.</p>
<p>See <i>Bell&rsquo;s</i> <i>Life</i>, <i>passim</i>, as &lsquo;The
Chicken got home on the cocoanut.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>The Explanation</h3>
<p>On the whole, either cocoanut kernels were called &lsquo;brains of
Tuna&rsquo; because &lsquo;cocoanut&rsquo;=&lsquo;head,&rsquo; and a
head has brains&mdash;and, well, somehow I fail to see why brains of
<i>Tuna</i> in particular!&nbsp; Or, there being a story to the effect
that the first cocoanut grew out of the head of the metamorphosed Tuna,
the kernel was called his brains.&nbsp; But why was the story told,
and why of Tuna?&nbsp; Tuna was an eel, and women may not eat eels;
and Ina was the moon, who, a Mangaian Selene, loved no Latmian shepherd,
but an eel.&nbsp; Seriously, I fail to understand Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
explanation.&nbsp; Given the problem, to explain a no longer intelligible
plant-name&mdash;brains of Tuna&mdash;(applied not to a plant but to
the kernel of a nut), this name is explained by saying that the moon,
Ina, loved an eel, cut off his head at his desire, and buried it.&nbsp;
Thence sprang cocoanut trees, with a fanciful likeness to a human face&mdash;face
of Tuna&mdash;on the nut.&nbsp; But still, why Tuna?&nbsp; How could
the moon love an eel, except on my own general principle of savage &lsquo;levelling
up&rsquo; of all life in all nature?&nbsp; In my opinion, the Mangaians
wanted a fable to account for the resemblance of a cocoanut to the human
head&mdash;a resemblance noted, as I show, in our own popular slang.&nbsp;
The Mangaians also knew the moon, in her mythical aspect, as Ina; and
Tuna, whatever his name may mean (Mr. Max M&uuml;ller does not tell
us), was an eel. <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17">{17}</a>&nbsp;
Having the necessary savage major premise in their minds, &lsquo;All
life is on a level and interchangeable,&rsquo; the Mangaians thought
well to say that the head-like cocoanut sprang from the head of her
lover, an eel, cut off by Ina.&nbsp; The myth accounts, I think, for
the peculiarities of the cocoanut, rather than for the name &lsquo;brains
of Tuna;&rsquo; for we still ask, &lsquo;Why of Tuna in particular?&nbsp;
Why Tuna more than Rangoa, or anyone else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall have to confess that the legend of Tuna throws but
little light on the legend of Daphne, or on the etymology of her name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I never hinted that the legend of Tuna threw light on the etymology
of the name of Daphne.&nbsp; Mangaian and Greek are not allied languages.&nbsp;
Nor did I give the Tuna story as an explanation of the Daphne story.&nbsp;
I gave it as one in a mass of illustrations of the savage mental propensity
so copiously established by Dr. Tylor in <i>Primitive</i> <i>Culture</i>.&nbsp;
The two alternative explanations which I gave of the Daphne story I
have cited.&nbsp; No mention of Tuna occurs in either.</p>
<h3>Disease of Language and Folk-etymology</h3>
<p>The Tuna story is described as &lsquo;a clear case of disease of
language cured by the ordinary nostrum of folk-etymology.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The &lsquo;disease&rsquo; showed itself, I suppose, in the presence
of the Mangaian words for &lsquo;brain of Tuna.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the
story of Tuna gives no folk-etymology of the name Tuna.&nbsp; Now, to
give an etymology of a name of forgotten meaning is the sole object
of folk-etymology.&nbsp; The plant-name, &lsquo;snake&rsquo;s head,&rsquo;
given as an example by Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, needs no etymological explanation.&nbsp;
A story may be told to explain why the plant is called snake&rsquo;s
head, but a story to give an etymology of snake&rsquo;s head is superfluous.&nbsp;
The Tuna story explains why the cocoanut kernel is called &lsquo;brains
of Tuna,&rsquo; but it offers no etymology of Tuna&rsquo;s name.&nbsp;
On the other hand, the story that marmalade (really <i>marmalet</i>)
is so called because Queen Mary found comfort in marmalade when she
was sea-sick&mdash;hence <i>Marie</i>-<i>malade</i>, hence <i>marmalade</i>&mdash;gives
an etymological explanation of the origin of the <i>word</i> marmalade.&nbsp;
Here is a real folk-etymology.&nbsp; We must never confuse such myths
of folk-etymology with myths arising (on the philological hypothesis)
from &lsquo;disease of language.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus, Daphne is a girl
pursued by Apollo, and changed into a daphne plant or laurel, or a laurel
springs from the earth where she was buried.&nbsp; On Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
philological theory Daphne=Dahan&acirc;, and meant &lsquo;the burning
one.&rsquo;&nbsp; Apollo may be derived from a Sanskrit form, *Apa-var-yan,
or *Apa-val-yan (though how Greeks ever heard a Sanskrit word, if such
a word as Apa-val-yan ever existed, we are not told), and may mean &lsquo;one
who opens the gate of the sky&rsquo; (ii. 692-696). <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18">{18}</a>&nbsp;
At some unknown date the ancestors of the Greeks would say &lsquo;The
opener of the gates of the sky (*Apa-val-yan, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. the
sun) pursues the burning one (Dahan&acirc;, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. the dawn).&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Greek language would retain this poetic saying in daily use till,
in the changes of speech, *Apa-val-yan ceased to be understood, and
became Apollo, while Dahan&acirc; ceased to be understood, and became
Daphne.&nbsp; But the verb being still understood, the phrase ran, &lsquo;Apollo
pursues Daphne.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now the Greeks had a plant, laurel, called
<i>daphne</i>.&nbsp; They therefore blended plant, daphne, and heroine&rsquo;s
name, Daphne, and decided that the phrase &lsquo;Apollo pursues Daphne&rsquo;
meant that Apollo chased a nymph, Daphne, who, to escape his love, turned
into a laurel.&nbsp; I cannot give Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s theory
of the Daphne story more clearly.&nbsp; If I misunderstand it, that
does not come from want of pains.</p>
<p>In opposition to it we urge that (1) the etymological equations,
Daphne=Dahan&acirc;, Apollo=*Apa-val-yan, are not generally accepted
by other scholars.&nbsp; Schr&ouml;der, in fact, derives Apollo &lsquo;from
the Vedic Saparagenya, &ldquo;worshipful,&rdquo; an epithet of Agni,&rsquo;
who is Fire (ii. 688), and so on.&nbsp; Daphne=Dahan&acirc; is no less
doubted.&nbsp; Of course a Greek simply cannot be &lsquo;derived&rsquo;
from a Sanskrit word, as is stated, though both may have a common origin,
just as French is not &lsquo;derived from&rsquo; Italian.</p>
<p>(2) If the etymologies were accepted, no proof is offered to us of
the actual existence, as a <i>vera</i> <i>causa</i>, of the process
by which a saying.&nbsp; &lsquo;Apollo pursues Daphne,&rsquo; remains
in language, while the meaning of the words is forgotten.&nbsp; This
process is essential, but undemonstrated.&nbsp; See the chapter here
on &lsquo;The Riddle Theory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3) These processes, if demonstrated, which they are not, must be
carefully discriminated from the actual demonstrable process of folk-etymology.&nbsp;
The Marmalade legend gives the etymology of a word, marmalade; the Daphne
legend does not give an etymology.</p>
<p>(4) The theory of Daphne is of the kind protested against by Mannhardt,
where he warns us against looking in most myths for a &lsquo;mirror-picture&rsquo;
on earth of celestial phenomena. <a name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a">{20a}</a>&nbsp;
For these reasons, among others, I am disinclined to accept Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s attempt to explain the story of Daphne.</p>
<h3>Mannhardt on Daphne</h3>
<p>Since we shall presently find Mr. Max M&uuml;ller claiming the celebrated
Mannhardt as a sometime deserter of philological comparative mythology,
who &lsquo;returned to his old colours,&rsquo; I observe with pleasure
that Mannhardt is on my side and against the Oxford Professor.&nbsp;
Mannhardt shows that the laurel (<i>daphne</i>) was regarded as a plant
which, like our rowan tree, averts evil influences.&nbsp; &lsquo;Moreover,
the laurel, like the <i>Maibaum</i>, was looked on as a being with a
spirit.&nbsp; This is the safest result which myth analysis can extract
from the story of Daphne, a nymph pursued by Apollo and changed into
a laurel.&nbsp; It is a result of the use of the laurel in his ritual.&rsquo;
<a name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b">{20b}</a>&nbsp; In
1877, a year after Mannhardt is said by Mr. Max M&uuml;ller to have
returned to his old colours, he repeats this explanation. <a name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a">{21a}</a>&nbsp;
In the same work (p. 20) he says that &lsquo;there is no reason for
accepting Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s explanation about the Sun-god and
the Dawn, <i>wo</i> <i>jeder</i> <i>th&auml;tliche</i> <i>Anhalt</i>
<i>daf&uuml;r</i> <i>fehlt</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; For this opinion we might
also cite the Sanskrit scholars Whitney and Bergaigne. <a name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b">{21b}</a></p>
<h2>THE QUESTION OF ALLIES</h2>
<h3>Athanasius</h3>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller protests, most justly, against the statement
that he, like St. Athanasius, stands alone, <i>contra</i> <i>mundum</i>.&nbsp;
If ever this phrase fell from my pen (in what connection I know not),
it is as erroneous as the position of St. Athanasius is honourable.&nbsp;
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s ideas, in various modifications, are doubtless
still the most prevalent of any.&nbsp; The anthropological method has
hardly touched, I think, the learned contributors to Roscher&rsquo;s
excellent mythological Lexicon.&nbsp; Dr. Brinton, whose American researches
are so useful, seems decidedly to be a member of the older school.&nbsp;
While I do not exactly remember alluding to Athanasius, I fully and
freely withdraw the phrase.&nbsp; But there remain questions of allies
to be discussed.</p>
<h3>Italian Critics</h3>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller asks, <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22">{22}</a>
&lsquo;What would Mr. Andrew Lang say if he read the words of Signer
Canizzaro, in his &ldquo;Genesi ed Evoluzione del Mito&rdquo; (1893),
&ldquo;Lang has laid down his arms before his adversaries&rdquo;?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Lang &lsquo;would smile.&rsquo;&nbsp; And what would Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
say if he read the words of Professor Enrico Morselli, &lsquo;Lang gives
no quarter to his adversaries, who, for the rest, have long been reduced
to silence&rsquo;? <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23">{23}</a>&nbsp;
The Right Hon. Professor also smiles, no doubt.&nbsp; We both smile.&nbsp;
<i>Solvuntur</i> <i>risu</i> <i>tabul&aelig;</i>.</p>
<h3>A Dutch Defender</h3>
<p>The question of the precise attitude of Professor Tiele, the accomplished
Gifford Lecturer in the University of Edinburgh (1897), is more important
and more difficult.&nbsp; His remarks were made in 1885, in an essay
on the Myth of Cronos, and were separately reprinted, in 1886, from
the &lsquo;Revue de l&rsquo;Histoire des Religions,&rsquo; which I shall
cite.&nbsp; Where they refer to myself they deal with <i>Custom</i>
<i>and</i> <i>Myth</i>, not with <i>Myth</i>, <i>Ritual</i>, <i>and</i>
<i>Religion</i> (1887).&nbsp; It seems best to quote, <i>ipsissimis</i>
<i>verbis</i>, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s comments on Professor Tiele&rsquo;s
remarks.&nbsp; He writes (i. viii.):</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us proceed next to Holland.&nbsp; Professor Tiele, who
had actually been claimed as an ally of the victorious army, declares:&mdash;&ldquo;Je
dois m&rsquo;&eacute;lever, au nom de la science mythologique et de
l&rsquo;exactitude . . . centre une m&eacute;thode qui ne fait que glisser
sur des probl&egrave;mes de premi&egrave;re importance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(See further on, p. 35.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;And again:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ces braves gens qui, pour peu qu&rsquo;ils aient lu
un ou deux livres de mythologie et d&rsquo;anthropologie, et un ou deux
r&eacute;cits de voyages, ne manqueront pas de se mettre &agrave; comparer
&agrave; tort et &agrave; travers, et pour tout r&eacute;sultat produiront
la confusion.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again (i. 35):</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides Signer Canizzaro and Mr. Horatio Hale, the veteran
among comparative ethnologists, Professor Tiele, in his Le Mythe de
Kronos (1886), has very strongly protested against the downright misrepresentations
of what I and my friends have really written.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Professor Tiele had been appealed to as an unimpeachable authority.&nbsp;
He was even claimed as an ally by the ethnological students of customs
and myths, but he strongly declined that honour (1. c., p. 31):-</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;M. Lang m&rsquo;a fait 1&rsquo;honneur de me citer,&rdquo;
he writes, &ldquo;comme un de ses alli&eacute;s, et j&rsquo;ai lieu
de croire que M. Gaidoz en fait en quelque mesure autant.&nbsp; Ces
messieurs n&rsquo;ont point enti&egrave;rement tort.&nbsp; Cependant
je dois m&rsquo;&eacute;lever, au nom de la science mythologique et
de 1&rsquo;exactitude dont elle ne peut pas plus se passer que les autres
sciences, contre une m&eacute;thode qui ne fait que glisser sur des
probl&egrave;mes de premi&egrave;re importance,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speaking of the whole method followed by those who actually
claimed to have founded a new school of mythology, he says (p. 21):&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Je crains toutefois que ce qui s&rsquo;y trouve de
vrai ne soit connu depuis longtemps, et que la nouvelle &eacute;cole
ne p&egrave;che par exclusionisme tout autant que les a&icirc;n&eacute;es
qu&rsquo;elle combat avec tant de conviction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is exactly what I have always said.&nbsp; What is there
new in comparing the customs and myths of the Greeks with those of the
barbarians?&nbsp; Has not even Plato done this?&nbsp; Did anybody doubt
that the Greeks, nay even the Hindus, were uncivilised or savages, before
they became civilised or tamed?&nbsp; Was not this common-sense view,
so strongly insisted on by Fontenelle and Vico in the eighteenth century,
carried even to excess by such men as De Brosses (1709-1771)?&nbsp;
And have the lessons taught to De Brosses by his witty contemporaries
been quite forgotten?&nbsp; Must his followers be told again and again
that they ought to begin with a critical examination of the evidence
put before them by casual travellers, and that mythology is as little
made up of one and the same material as the crust of the earth of granite
only?&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Reply</h3>
<p>Professor Tiele wrote in 1885.&nbsp; I do not remember having claimed
his alliance, though I made one or two very brief citations from his
remarks on the dangers of etymology applied to old proper names. <a name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a">{25a}</a>&nbsp;
To citations made by me later in 1887 Professor Tiele cannot be referring.
<a name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b">{25b}</a>&nbsp; Thus
I find no proof of any claim of alliance put forward by me, but I do
claim a right to quote the Professor&rsquo;s published words.&nbsp;
These I now translate:&mdash;<a name="citation25c"></a><a href="#footnote25c">{25c}</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;What goes before shows adequately that I am an ally, much
more than an adversary, of the new school, whether styled ethnological
or anthropological.&nbsp; It is true that all the ideas advanced by
its partisans are not so new as they seem.&nbsp; Some of us&mdash;I
mean among those who, without being vassals of the old school, were
formed by it&mdash;had not only remarked already the defects of the
reigning method, but had perceived the direction in which researches
should be made; they had even begun to say so.&nbsp; This does not prevent
the young school from enjoying the great merit of having first formulated
with precision, and with the energy of conviction, that which had hitherto
been but imperfectly pointed out.&nbsp; If henceforth mythological science
marches with a firmer foot, and loses much of its hypothetical character,
it will in part owe this to the stimulus of the new school.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Braves Gens&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Professor Tiele then bids us leave our cries of triumph to the <i>servum</i>
<i>imitatorum</i> <i>pecus</i>, <i>braves</i> <i>gens</i>, and so forth,
as in the passage which Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, unless I misunderstand
him, regards as referring to the &lsquo;new school,&rsquo; and, notably,
to M. Gaidoz and myself, though such language ought not to apply to
M. Gaidoz, because he is a scholar.&nbsp; I am left to uncovenanted
mercies.</p>
<h3>Professor Tiele on Our Merits</h3>
<p>The merits of the new school Professor Tiele had already stated:&mdash;<a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26">{26}</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;If I were reduced to choose between this method and that of
comparative philology, I would prefer the former without the slightest
hesitation.&nbsp; This method alone enables us to explain the fact,
such a frequent cause of surprise, that the Greeks like the Germans
. . . could attribute to their gods all manner of cruel, cowardly and
dissolute actions.&nbsp; This method alone reveals the cause of all
the strange metamorphoses of gods into animals, plants, and even stones.
. . .&nbsp; In fact, this method teaches us to recognise in all these
oddities the survivals of an age of barbarism long over-past, but lingering
into later times, under the form of religious legends, the most persistent
of all traditions. . . .&nbsp; This method, <i>enfin</i>, can alone
help us to account for the genesis of myths, because it devotes itself
to studying them in their rudest and most primitive shape. . . . &rsquo;</p>
<h3>Destruction and Construction</h3>
<p>Thus writes Professor Tiele about the constructive part of our work.&nbsp;
As to the destructive&mdash;or would-be destructive&mdash;part, he condenses
my arguments against the method of comparative philology.&nbsp; &lsquo;To
resume, the whole house of comparative philological mythology is builded
on the sand, and her method does not deserve confidence, since it ends
in such divergent results.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is Professor Tiele&rsquo;s
statement of my destructive conclusions, and he adds, &lsquo;So far,
I have not a single objection to make.&nbsp; I can still range myself
on Mr. Lang&rsquo;s side when he&rsquo; takes certain distinctions into
which it is needless to go here. <a name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27">{27}</a></p>
<h3>Allies or Not?</h3>
<p>These are several of the passages on which, in 1887, I relied as
evidence of the Professor&rsquo;s approval, which, I should have added,
is only partial It is he who, unsolicited, professes himself &lsquo;much
more our ally than our adversary.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is he who proclaims
that Mr. Max Midler&rsquo;s central hypothesis is erroneous, and who
makes &lsquo;no objection&rsquo; to my idea that it is &lsquo;builded
on the sand.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is he who assigns essential merits to our
method, and I fail to find that he &lsquo;strongly declines the honour&rsquo;
of our alliance.&nbsp; The passage about &lsquo;braves gens&rsquo; explicitly
does not refer to us.</p>
<h3>Our Errors</h3>
<p>In 1887, I was not careful to quote what Professor Tiele had said
against us.&nbsp; First, as to our want of novelty.&nbsp; That merit,
I think, I had never claimed.&nbsp; I was proud to point out that we
had been anticipated by Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea, by Fontenelle, and
doubtless by many others.&nbsp; We repose, as Professor Tiele justly
says, on the researches of Dr. Tylor.&nbsp; At the same time it is Professor
Tiele who constantly speaks of &lsquo;the new school,&rsquo; while adding
that he himself had freely opposed Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s central
hypothesis, &lsquo;a disease of language,&rsquo; in Dutch periodicals.&nbsp;
The Professor also censures our &lsquo;exclusiveness,&rsquo; our &lsquo;narrowness,&rsquo;
our &lsquo;songs of triumph,&rsquo; our use of parody (M. Gaidoz republished
an old one, not to my own taste; I have also been guilty of &lsquo;The
Great Gladstone Myth&rsquo;) and our charge that our adversaries neglect
ethnological material.&nbsp; On this I explain myself later. <a name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a">{28a}</a></p>
<h3>Uses of Philology</h3>
<p>Our method (says Professor Tiele) &lsquo;cannot answer all the questions
which the science of mythology must solve, or, at least, must study.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Certainly it makes no such pretence.</p>
<p>Professor Tiele then criticises Sir George Cox and Mr. Robert Brown,
junior, for their etymologies of Poseidon.&nbsp; Indiscreet followers
are not confined to our army alone.&nbsp; Now, the use of philology,
we learn, is to discourage such etymological vagaries as those of Sir
G. Cox. <a name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b">{28b}</a>&nbsp;
<i>We</i> also discourage them&mdash;severely.&nbsp; But we are warned
that philology really has discovered &lsquo;some undeniably certain
etymologies&rsquo; of divine names.&nbsp; Well, I also say, &lsquo;Philology
alone can tell whether Zeus Asterios, or Adonis, or Zeus Labrandeus
is originally a Semitic or a Greek divine name; here she is the Pythoness
we must all consult.&rsquo; <a name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a">{29a}</a>&nbsp;
And is it my fault that, even in this matter, the Pythonesses utter
such strangely discrepant oracles?&nbsp; Is Athene from a Zend root
(Benfey), a Greek root (Curtius), or to be interpreted by Sanskrit <i>Ahan&acirc;</i>
(Max M&uuml;ller)?&nbsp; Meanwhile Professor Tiele repeats that, in
a search for the origin of myths, and, above all, of obscene and brutal
myths, &lsquo;philology will lead us far from our aim.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Now, if the school of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller has a <i>mot</i> <i>d&rsquo;ordre</i>,
it is, says Professor Tiele, &lsquo;to call mythology a disease of language.&rsquo;
<a name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b">{29b}</a>&nbsp; But,
adds Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s learned Dutch defender, mythologists,
while using philology for certain purposes, &lsquo;must shake themselves
free, of course, from the false hypothesis&rsquo; (Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s)
&lsquo;which makes of mythology a mere <i>maladie</i> <i>du</i> <i>langage</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This professor is rather a dangerous defender of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller!&nbsp;
He removes the very corner-stone of his edifice, which Tiele does not
object to our describing as founded on the sand.&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
does not cite (as far as I observe) these passages in which Professor
Tiele (in my view, and in fact) abandons (for certain uses) <i>his</i>
system of mythology.&nbsp; Perhaps Professor Tiele has altered his mind,
and, while keeping what Mr. Max M&uuml;ller quotes, <i>braves</i> <i>gens</i>,
and so on, has withdrawn what he said about &lsquo;the false hypothesis
of a disease of language.&rsquo;&nbsp; But my own last book about myths
was written in 1886-1887, shortly after Professor Tiele&rsquo;s remarks
were published (1886) as I have cited them.</p>
<h3>Personal Controversy</h3>
<p>All this matter of alliances may seem, and indeed is, of a personal
character, and therefore unimportant.&nbsp; Professor Tiele&rsquo;s
position in 1885-86 is clearly defined.&nbsp; Whatever he may have published
since, he then accepted the anthropological or ethnological method,
as <i>alone</i> capable of doing the work in which we employ it.&nbsp;
This method alone can discover the origin of ancient myths, and alone
can account for the barbaric element, that old puzzle, in the myths
of civilised races.&nbsp; This the philological method, useful for other
purposes, cannot do, and its central hypothesis can only mislead us.&nbsp;
I was not aware, I repeat, that I ever claimed Professor Tiele&rsquo;s
&lsquo;alliance,&rsquo; as he, followed by Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, declares.&nbsp;
They cannot point, as a proof of an assertion made by Professor Tiele,
1885-86, to words of mine which did not see the light till 1887, in
<i>Myth</i>, <i>Ritual</i>, <i>and</i> <i>Religion</i>, i. pp. 24, 43,
44.&nbsp; Not that I deny Professor Tiele&rsquo;s statement about my
claim of his alliance before 1885-86.&nbsp; I merely ask for a reference
to this claim.&nbsp; In 1887 <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30">{30}</a>
I cited his observations (already quoted) on the inadequate and misleading
character of the philological method, when we are seeking for &lsquo;the
origin of a myth, or the physical explanation of the oldest myths, or
trying to account for the rude and obscene element in the divine legends
of civilised races.&rsquo;&nbsp; I added the Professor&rsquo;s applause
of the philological method as applied to other problems of mythology;
for example, &lsquo;the genealogical relations of myths. . . .&nbsp;
The philological method alone can answer here,&rsquo; aided, doubtless,
by historical and arch&aelig;ological researches as to the inter-relations
of races.&nbsp; This approval of the philological method, I cited; the
reader will find the whole passage in the <i>Revue</i>, vol. xii. p.
260.&nbsp; I remarked, however, that this will seem &lsquo;a very limited
province,&rsquo; though, in this province, &lsquo;Philology is the Pythoness
we must all consult; in this sphere she is supreme, when her high priests
are of one mind.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus I did not omit to notice Professor
Tiele&rsquo;s comments on the <i>merits</i> of the philological method.&nbsp;
To be sure, he himself does not apply it when he comes to examine the
Myth of Cronos.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are the God and his myth original or imported?&nbsp;
I have not approached this question because it does not seem to me ripe
in this particular case.&rsquo; <a name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a">{31a}</a>&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mr. Lang has justly rejected the opinion of Welcker and Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller, that Cronos is simply formed from Zeus&rsquo;s epithet,
&kappa;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&omega;&nu;.&rsquo; <a name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b">{31b}</a>&nbsp;
This opinion, however, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller still thinks the &lsquo;most
likely&rsquo; (ii. 507).</p>
<p>My other citation of Professor Tiele in 1887 says that our pretensions
&lsquo;are not unacknowledged&rsquo; by him, and, after a long quotation
of approving passages, I add &lsquo;the method is thus <i>applauded</i>
by a most competent authority, and it has been <i>warmly</i> <i>accepted</i>&rsquo;
(pray note the distinction) by M. Gaidoz. <a name="citation31c"></a><a href="#footnote31c">{31c}</a>&nbsp;
I trust that what I have said is not unfair.&nbsp; Professor Tiele&rsquo;s
objections, not so much to our method as to our manners, and to my own
use of the method in a special case, have been stated, or will be stated
later.&nbsp; Probably I should have put them forward in 1887; I now
repair my error.&nbsp; My sole wish is to be fair; if Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
has not wholly succeeded in giving the full drift of Professor Tiele&rsquo;s
remarks, I am certain that it is from no lack of candour.</p>
<h3>The Story of Cronos</h3>
<p>Professor Tiele now devotes fifteen pages to the story of Cronos,
and to my essay on that theme.&nbsp; He admits that I was right in regarding
the myth as &lsquo;extraordinarily old,&rsquo; and that in Greece it
must go back to a period when Greeks had not passed the New Zealand
level of civilisation.&nbsp; [Now, the New Zealanders were cannibals!]&nbsp;
But &lsquo;we are the victims of a great illusion if we think that a
mere comparison of a Maori and Greek myth explains the myth.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I only profess to explain the savagery of the myth by the fact (admitted)
that it was composed by savages.&nbsp; The Maori story &lsquo;is a myth
of the creation of light.&rsquo;&nbsp; I, for my part, say, &lsquo;It
is a myth of the severance of heaven and earth.&rsquo; <a name="citation32a"></a><a href="#footnote32a">{32a}</a>&nbsp;
And so it is!&nbsp; No Being said, in Maori, &lsquo;Fiat lux!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Light is not here <i>created</i>.&nbsp; Heaven lay flat on Earth, all
was dark, somebody kicked Heaven up, the already existing light came
in.&nbsp; Here is no <i>cr&eacute;ation</i> <i>de</i> <i>la</i> <i>lumi&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp;
I ask Professor Tiele, &lsquo;Do you, sir, create light when you open
your window-shutters in the morning?&nbsp; No, you let light in!&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Maori tale is also &lsquo;un mythe primitif de l&rsquo;aurore,&rsquo;
a primitive dawn myth.&nbsp; Dawn, again!&nbsp; Here I lose Professor
Tiele.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has the myth of Cronos the same sense?&rsquo;&nbsp; Probably
not, as the Maori story, to my mind, has not got it either.&nbsp; But
Professor Tiele says, &lsquo;The myth of Cronos has precisely the opposite
sense.&rsquo; <a name="citation32b"></a><a href="#footnote32b">{32b}</a>&nbsp;
What is the myth of Cronos?&nbsp; Ouranos (Heaven) married Gaea (Earth).&nbsp;
Ouranos &lsquo;hid his children from the light in the <i>hollows</i>
of Earth&rsquo; (Hesiod).&nbsp; So, too, the New Zealand gods were hidden
from light while Heaven (Rangi) lay flat on Papa (Earth).&nbsp; The
children &lsquo;were concealed between the <i>hollows</i> of their parent&rsquo;s
breasts.&rsquo;&nbsp; They did not like it, for they dwelt in darkness.&nbsp;
So Cronos took an iron sickle and mutilated Ouranos in such a way, <i>enfin</i>,
as to divorce him <i>a</i> <i>thoro</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thus,&rsquo; I
say, &lsquo;were Heaven and Earth practically divorced.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Greek gods now came out of the hollows where they had been, like
the New Zealand gods, &lsquo;hidden from the light.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Professor Tiele on Sunset Myths</h3>
<p>No, says Professor Tiele, &lsquo;the story of Cronos has precisely
the opposite meaning.&rsquo;&nbsp; The New Zealand myth is one of dawn,
the Greek myth is one of sunset.&nbsp; The mutilated part of poor Ouranos
is <i>le</i> <i>phallus</i> <i>du</i> <i>ciel</i>, <i>le</i> <i>soleil</i>,
which falls into &lsquo;the Cosmic ocean,&rsquo; and then, of course,
all is dark.&nbsp; Professor Tiele may be right here; I am indifferent.&nbsp;
All that I wanted to explain was the savage complexion of the myth,
and Professor Tiele says that I have explained that, and (xii. 264)
he rejects the etymological theory of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller.</p>
<p>I say that, in my opinion, the second part of the Cronos myth (the
child-swallowing performances of Cronos) &lsquo;was probably a world-wide
<i>M&auml;rchen</i>, or tale, attracted into the cycle of which Cronos
was the centre, without any particular reason beyond the law which makes
detached myths crystallise round any celebrated name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Professor Tiele says he does not grasp the meaning of, or believe
in, any such law.&nbsp; Well, why is the world-wide tale of the Cyclops
told about Odysseus?&nbsp; It is absolutely out of keeping, and it puzzles
commentators.&nbsp; In fact, here was a hero and there was a tale, and
the tale was attracted into the cycle of the hero; the very last man
to have behaved as Odysseus is made to do. <a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34">{34}</a>&nbsp;
But Cronos was an odious ruffian.&nbsp; The world-wide tale of swallowing
and disgorging the children was attracted to <i>his</i> too notorious
name &lsquo;by grace of congruity.&rsquo;&nbsp; Does Professor Tiele
now grasp my meaning (<i>saisir</i>)?</p>
<h3>Our Lack of Scientific Exactness</h3>
<p>I do not here give at full length Professor Tiele&rsquo;s explanation
of the meaning of a myth which I do not profess to explain myself.&nbsp;
Thus, drops of the blood of Ouranos falling on Earth begat the <i>M&eacute;lies</i>,
usually rendered &lsquo;Nymphs of the Ash-trees.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Professor
Tiele says they were really <i>bees</i> (Hesychius, &mu;&epsilon;&lambda;&iota;&alpha;&iota;<i>=</i>&mu;&epsilon;&lambda;&iota;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;&iota;)&mdash;&lsquo;that
is to say, stars.&rsquo;&nbsp; Everybody has observed that the stars
rise up off the earth, like the bees sprung from the blood of Ouranos.&nbsp;
In <i>Myth</i>, <i>Ritual</i>, <i>and</i> <i>Religion</i> (i. 299-315)
I give the competing explanations of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, of Schwartz
(Cronos=storm god), Preller (Cronos=harvest god), of others who see
the sun, or time, in Cronos; while, with Professor Tiele, Cronos is
the god of the upper air, and also of the underworld and harvest; he
&lsquo;doubles the part.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Il</i> <i>est</i> <i>l&rsquo;un</i>
<i>et</i> <i>l&rsquo;autre&rsquo;</i>&mdash;that is, &lsquo;<i>le</i>
<i>dieu</i> <i>qui</i> <i>fait</i> <i>m&ucirc;rir</i> <i>le</i> <i>bl&eacute;</i>&rsquo;
and also &lsquo;<i>un</i> <i>dieu</i> <i>des</i> <i>lieux</i> <i>souterrains</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Il</i> <i>habite</i> <i>les</i> <i>profondeurs</i> <i>sous</i>
<i>la</i> <i>terre</i>,&rsquo; he is also <i>le</i> <i>dieu</i> <i>du</i>
<i>ciel</i> <i>nocturne</i>.</p>
<p>It may have been remarked that I declined to add to this interesting
collection of plausible explanations of Cronos.&nbsp; A selection of
such explanations I offer in tabular form:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Cronos</i> <i>was</i> <i>God</i> <i>of</i></p>
<p>Time (?)&mdash;Max M&uuml;ller<br />
Sun&mdash;Sayce<br />
Midnight sky&mdash;Kuhn</p>
<p>Under-world }<br />

Harvest }</p>
<p>Harvest&mdash;Preller<br />

<p><i>Cronos</i> <i>was</i> <i>by</i> <i>Race</i></p>

Kr&#257;na (Sanskrit)&mdash;Kuhn<br />
Karnos (Horned)&mdash;Brown<br />
&kappa;&rho;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&omega;&mdash;Preller</p>
<p>The pleased reader will also observe that the <i>phallus</i> of Ouranos
is the sun (Tiele), that Cronos is the sun (Sayce), that Cronos mutilating
Ouranos is the sun (Hartung), just as the sun is the mutilated part
of Ouranos (Tiele); <i>Or</i> is, according to others, the stone which
Cronos swallowed, and which acted as an emetic.</p>
<h3>My Lack of Explanation of Cronos</h3>
<p>Now, I have offered no explanation at all of who Cronos was, what
he was god of, from what race he was borrowed, from what language his
name was derived.&nbsp; The fact is that I do not know the truth about
these important debated questions.&nbsp; Therefore, after speaking so
kindly of our method, and rejecting the method of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller,
Professor Tiele now writes thus (and <i>this</i> Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
does cite, as we have seen):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mr. Lang and M. Gaidoz are not entirely wrong
in claiming me as an ally.&nbsp; But I must protest, in the name of
mythological science, and of the exactness as necessary to her as to
any of the other sciences, against a method which only glides over questions
of the first importance&rsquo; (name, origin, province, race of Cronos),
&lsquo;and which to most questions can only reply, with a smile, <i>C&rsquo;est</i>
<i>chercher</i> <i>raison</i> <i>o&ugrave;</i> <i>il</i> <i>n&rsquo;y</i>
<i>en</i> <i>a</i> <i>pas</i>.<i>&rsquo;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>My Crime</h3>
<p>Now, what important questions was I gliding over?&nbsp; In what questions
did I not expect to find reason?&nbsp; Why in this savage <i>fatras</i>
about Cronos swallowing his children, about blood-drops becoming bees
(Mr. Max M&uuml;ller says &lsquo;Melian nymphs&rsquo;), and bees being
stars, and all the rest of a prehistoric <i>M&auml;rchen</i> worked
over again and again by the later fancy of Greek poets and by Greek
voyagers who recognised Cronos in Moloch.&nbsp; In all this I certainly
saw no &lsquo;reason,&rsquo; but I have given in tabular form the general,
if inharmonious, conclusions of more exact and conscientious scholars,
&lsquo;their variegated hypotheses,&rsquo; as Mannhardt says in the
case of Demeter.&nbsp; My error, rebuked by Professor Tiele, is the
lack of that &lsquo;scientific exactitude&rsquo; exhibited by the explanations
arranged in my tabular form.</p>
<h3>My Reply to Professor Tiele</h3>
<p>I would reply that I am not engaged in a study of the <i>Cult</i>
of Cronos, but of the revolting element in his <i>Myth</i>: his swallowing
of his children, taking a stone emetic by mistake, and disgorging the
swallowed children alive; the stone being on view at Delphi long after
the Christian era.&nbsp; Now, such stories of divine feats of swallowing
and disgorging are very common, I show, in savage myth and popular <i>M&auml;rchen</i>.&nbsp;
The bushmen have Kwai Hemm, who swallows the sacred Mantis insect.&nbsp;
He is killed, and all the creatures whom he has swallowed return to
light.&nbsp; Such stories occur among Australians, Kaffirs, Red Men,
in Guiana, in Greenland, and so on.&nbsp; In some cases, among savages.&nbsp;
Night (conceived as a person), or one star which obscures another star,
is said to &lsquo;swallow&rsquo; it.&nbsp; Therefore, I say, &lsquo;natural
phenomena, explained on savage principles, might give the data of the
swallowing myth, of Cronos&rsquo; <a name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37">{37}</a>&mdash;that
is, the myth of Cronos may be, probably is, originally a nature-myth.&nbsp;
&lsquo;On this principle Cronos would be (<i>ad</i> <i>hoc</i>) the
Night.&rsquo;&nbsp; Professor Tiele does not allude to this effort at
interpretation.&nbsp; But I come round to something like the view of
Kuhn.&nbsp; Cronos (<i>ad</i> <i>hoc</i>) is the midnight [sky], which
Professor Tiele also regards as one of his several aspects.&nbsp; It
is not impossible, I think, that if the swallowing myth was originally
a nature-myth, it was suggested by Night.&nbsp; But the question I tried
to answer was, &lsquo;Why did the Greeks, of all people, tell such a
disgusting story?&rsquo;&nbsp; And I replied, with Professor Tiele&rsquo;s
approval, that they inherited it from an age to which such follies were
natural, an age when the ancestors of the Greeks were on (or under)
the Maori stage of culture.&nbsp; Now, the Maoris, a noble race, with
poems of great beauty and speculative power, were cannibals, like Cronos.&nbsp;
To my mind, &lsquo;scientific exactitude&rsquo; is rather shown in confessing
ignorance than in adding to the list of guesses.</p>
<h3>Conclusion as to Professor Tiele</h3>
<p>The learned Professor&rsquo;s remarks on being &lsquo;much more my
ally than my opponent&rsquo; were published before my <i>Myth</i>, <i>Ritual</i>,
<i>and</i> <i>Religion</i>, in which (i. 24, 25) I cited his agreement
with me in the opinion that &lsquo;the philological method&rsquo; (Mr.
Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s) is &lsquo;inadequate and misleading, when it
is a question of discovering the origin of a myth.&rsquo;&nbsp; I also
quoted his unhesitating preference of ours to Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
method (i. 43, 44).&nbsp; I did not cite a tithe of what he actually
did say to our credit.&nbsp; But I omitted to quote what it was inexcusable
not to add, that Professor Tiele thinks us &lsquo;too exclusive,&rsquo;
that he himself had already, before us, combated Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
method in Dutch periodicals, that he blamed our &lsquo;songs of triumph&rsquo;
and our levities, that he thought we might have ignorant camp-followers,
that I glided over important questions (bees, blood-drops, stars, Melian
nymphs, the <i>phallus</i> of Ouranos, &amp;c.), and showed scientific
inexactitude in declining <i>chercher</i> <i>raison</i> <i>o&ugrave;</i>
<i>il</i> <i>n&rsquo;y</i> <i>en</i> <i>a</i> <i>pas</i>.</p>
<p>None the less, in Professor Tiele&rsquo;s opinion, our method is
new (or is <i>not</i> new), illuminating, successful, and <i>alone</i>
successful, for the ends to which we apply it, and, finally, we have
shown Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s method to be a house builded on the
sand.&nbsp; That is the gist of what Professor Tiele said.</p>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, like myself, quotes part and omits part.&nbsp;
He quotes twice Professor Tiele&rsquo;s observations on my deplorable
habit of gliding over important questions.&nbsp; He twice says that
we have &lsquo;actually&rsquo; claimed the Professor as &lsquo;an ally
of the victorious army,&rsquo; &lsquo;the ethnological students of custom
and myth,&rsquo; and once adds, &lsquo;but he strongly declined that
honour.&rsquo;&nbsp; He twice quotes the famous <i>braves</i> <i>gens</i>
passage, excepting only M. Gaidoz, as a scholar, from a censure explicitly
directed at our possible camp-followers as distinguished from ourselves.</p>
<p>But if Mr. Max M&uuml;ller quotes Professor Tiele&rsquo;s remarks
proving that, in his opinion, the &lsquo;army&rsquo; <i>is</i> really
victorious; if he cites the acquiescence in my opinion that <i>his</i>
mythological house is &lsquo;builded on the sands,&rsquo; or Professor
Tiele&rsquo;s preference for our method over his own, or Professor Tiele&rsquo;s
volunteered remark that he is &lsquo;much more our ally than our adversary,&rsquo;
I have not detected the passages in <i>Contributions</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i>
<i>Science</i> <i>of</i> <i>Mythology</i>.</p>
<p>The reader may decide as to the relative importance of what I left
out, and of what Mr. Max M&uuml;ller omitted.&nbsp; He says, &lsquo;Professor
Tiele and I differ on several points, but we perfectly understand each
other, and when we have made a mistake we readily confess and correct
it&rsquo; (i. 37).</p>
<p>The two scholars, I thought, differed greatly.&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
war-cry, slogan, <i>mot</i> <i>d&rsquo;ordre</i>, is to Professor Tiele
&lsquo;a false hypothesis.&rsquo;&nbsp; Our method, which Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
combats so bravely, is all that Professor Tiele has said of it.&nbsp;
But, if all this is not conspicuously apparent in our adversary&rsquo;s
book, it does not become me to throw the first stone.&nbsp; We are all,
in fact, inclined unconsciously to overlook what makes against our argument.&nbsp;
I have done it; and, to the best of my belief, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller has
not avoided the same error.</p>
<h2>MANNHARDT</h2>
<h3>Mannhardt&rsquo;s Attitude</h3>
<p>Professor Tiele, it may appear, really &lsquo;fights for his own
hand,&rsquo; and is not a thorough partisan of either side.&nbsp; The
celebrated Mannhardt, too, doubtless the most original student of folk-lore
since Grimm, might, at different periods of his career, have been reckoned
an ally, now by philologists, now by &lsquo;the new school.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He may be said, in fact, to have combined what is best in the methods
of both parties.&nbsp; Both are anxious to secure such support as his
works can lend.</p>
<h3>Moral Character Impeached</h3>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller avers that his moral character seems to be &lsquo;aimed
at&rsquo; by critics who say that he has no right to quote Mannhardt
or Oldenberg as his supporters (1. xvi.).&nbsp; Now, without making
absurd imputations, I do not reckon Mannhardt a thorough partisan of
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller.&nbsp; I could not put <i>our</i> theory so well
as Mannhardt puts it.&nbsp; &lsquo;The study of the lower races is an
invaluable instrument for the interpretation of the survivals from earlier
stages, which we meet in the full civilisation of cultivated peoples,
but which arose in the remotest fetishism and savagery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Like Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, I do not care for the vague word &lsquo;fetishism,&rsquo;
otherwise Mannhardt&rsquo;s remark exactly represents my own position,
the anthropological position. <a name="citation42a"></a><a href="#footnote42a">{42a}</a>&nbsp;
Now, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller does not like that position.&nbsp; That position
he assails.&nbsp; It was Mannhardt&rsquo;s, however, when he wrote the
book quoted, and, so far, Mannhardt was <i>not</i> absolutely one of
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s &lsquo;supporters&rsquo;&mdash;unless I
am one.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have even been accused,&rsquo; says Mr. Max M&uuml;ller,
&lsquo;of intentionally ignoring or suppressing Mannhardt&rsquo;s labours.&nbsp;
How charitable!&rsquo; (1. xvii.)&nbsp; I trust, from our author&rsquo;s
use of the word <i>todtschweigen</i>, that this uncharitable charge
was made in Germany.</p>
<h3>Mannhardt</h3>
<p>Mannhardt, for a time, says Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, &lsquo;expressed
his mistrust in some of the results of comparative mythology&rsquo;
(1. xvii.).&nbsp; Indeed, I myself quote him to that very effect. <a name="citation42b"></a><a href="#footnote42b">{42b}</a>&nbsp;
Not only &lsquo;<i>some</i> of the results,&rsquo; but the philological
method itself was distrusted by Mannhardt, as by Curtius.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
failure of the method in its practical working lies in a lack of the
historical sense,&rsquo; says Mannhardt. <a name="citation42c"></a><a href="#footnote42c">{42c}</a>&nbsp;
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller may have, probably has, referred to these sayings
of Mannhardt; or, if he has not, no author is obliged to mention everybody
who disagrees with him.&nbsp; Mannhardt&rsquo;s method was mainly that
of folklore, not of philology.&nbsp; He examined peasant customs and
rites as &lsquo;survivals&rsquo; of the oldest paganism.&nbsp; Mr. Frazer
applies Mannhardt&rsquo;s rich lore to the explanation of Greek and
other rites in <i>The</i> <i>Golden</i> <i>Bough</i>, that entrancing
book.&nbsp; Such was Mannhardt&rsquo;s position (as I shall prove at
large) when he was writing his most famous works.&nbsp; But he &lsquo;returned
at last to his old colours&rsquo; (1. xvii.) in <i>Die</i> <i>lettischen</i>
<i>Sonnenmythen</i> (1875).&nbsp; In 1880 Mannhardt died.&nbsp; Mr.
Max M&uuml;ller does not say whether Mannhardt, before a decease deeply
regretted, recanted his heretical views about the philological method,
and his expressed admiration of the study of the lower races as &lsquo;an
invaluable instrument.&rsquo;&nbsp; One would gladly read a recantation
so important.&nbsp; But Mr. Max M&uuml;ller does tell us that &lsquo;if
I did not refer to his work in my previous contributions to the science
of mythology the reason was simple enough.&nbsp; It was not, as has
been suggested, my wish to suppress it (<i>todtschweigen</i>), but simply
my want of knowledge of the materials with which he dealt&rsquo; (German
popular customs and traditions) &lsquo;and therefore the consciousness
of my incompetence to sit in judgment on his labours.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again,
we are told that there was no need of criticism or praise of Mannhardt.&nbsp;
He had Mr. Frazer as his prophet&mdash;but not till ten years after
his death.</p>
<h3>Mannhardt&rsquo;s Letters</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Mannhardt&rsquo;s state of mind with regard to the general
principles of comparative philology has been so exactly my own,&rsquo;
says Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, that he cites Mannhardt&rsquo;s letters to
prove the fact.&nbsp; But as to the <i>application</i> to myth of the
principles of comparative philology, Mannhardt speaks of &lsquo;the
lack of the historical sense&rsquo; displayed in the practical employment
of the method.&nbsp; This, at least, is &lsquo;not exactly&rsquo; Mr.
Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s own view.&nbsp; Probably he refers to the later
period when Mannhardt &lsquo;returned to his old colours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The letters of Mannhardt, cited in proof of his exact agreement with
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller about comparative philology, do not, as far as quoted,
mention the subject of comparative philology at all (1. xviii-xx.).&nbsp;
Possibly &lsquo;philology&rsquo; is here a slip of the pen, and &lsquo;mythology&rsquo;
may be meant.</p>
<p>Mannhardt says to M&uuml;llenhoff (May 2, 1876) that he has been
uneasy &lsquo;at the extent which sun myths threaten to assume in my
comparisons.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is opening &lsquo;a new point of view;&rsquo;
materials rush in, &lsquo;so that the sad danger seemed inevitable of
everything becoming everything.&rsquo;&nbsp; In Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
own words, written long ago, <i>he</i> expressed his dread, not of &lsquo;everything
becoming everything&rsquo; (a truly Heraclitean state of affairs), but
of the &lsquo;omnipresent Sun and the inevitable Dawn appearing in ever
so many disguises.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Have we not,&rsquo; he asks,
&lsquo;arrived both at the same conclusion?&rsquo;&nbsp; Really, I do
not know!&nbsp; Had Mannhardt quite cashiered &lsquo;the corn-spirit,&rsquo;
who, perhaps, had previously threatened to &lsquo;become everything&rsquo;?&nbsp;
He is still in great vigour, in Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s <i>Golden</i> <i>Bough</i>,
and Mr. Frazer is Mannhardt&rsquo;s disciple.&nbsp; But where, all this
time, is there a reference by Mannhardt to &lsquo;the general principles
of comparative philology&rsquo;?&nbsp; Where does he accept &lsquo;the
omnipresent Sun and the inevitable Dawn&rsquo;?&nbsp; Why, he says the
reverse; he says in this letter that he is immeasurably removed from
accepting them at all as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller accepts them!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very far from looking upon all myths as psychical reflections
of physical phenomena, still less as of exclusively solar or meteorological
phenomena, like Kuhn, Schwartz, Max M&uuml;ller and their school.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What a queer way of expressing his agreement with Mr. Max M&uuml;ller!</p>
<p>The Professor expostulates with Mannhardt (1. xx.):&mdash;&lsquo;Where
has any one of us ever done this?&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, when Mannhardt
said &lsquo;<i>all</i> myths,&rsquo; he wrote colloquially.&nbsp; Shall
we say that he meant &lsquo;most myths,&rsquo; &lsquo;a good many myths,&rsquo;
&lsquo;a myth or two here and there&rsquo;?&nbsp; Whatever he meant,
he meant that he was &lsquo;still more than very far removed from looking
upon all myths&rsquo; as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller does.</p>
<p>Mannhardt&rsquo;s next passage I quote entire and textually from
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s translation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I have learnt to appreciate poetical and literary
production as an essential element in the development of mythology,
and to draw and utilise the consequences arising from this state of
things.&nbsp; [Who has not?]&nbsp; But, on the other hand, I hold it
as quite certain that a portion of the older myths arose from nature
poetry which is no longer directly intelligible to us, but has to be
interpreted by means of analogies.&nbsp; Nor does it follow that these
myths betray any historical identity; they only testify to the same
kind of conception and tendency prevailing on similar stages of development.&nbsp;
Of these nature myths some have reference to the life and the circumstances
of the sun, and our first steps towards an understanding of them are
helped on by such nature poetry as the Lettish, which has not yet been
obscured by artistic and poetical reflexion.&nbsp; In that poetry mythical
personalities confessedly belonging to a solar sphere are transferred
to a large number of poetical representatives, of which the explanation
must consequently be found in the same (solar) sphere of nature.&nbsp;
My method here is just the same as that applied by me to the Tree-cult.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller asks, &lsquo;Where is there any difference between
this, the latest and final system adopted by Mannhardt, and my own system
which I put forward in 1856?&rsquo; (1. xxi.)</p>
<h3>How Mannhardt differs from Mr. Max M&uuml;ller</h3>
<p>I propose to show wherein the difference lies.&nbsp; Mannhardt says,
&lsquo;My method is just the same as that applied by me to the Tree-cult.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What was <i>that</i> method?</p>
<p>Mannhardt, in the letter quoted by Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, goes on to
describe it; but Mr. Max M&uuml;ller omits the description, probably
not realising its importance.&nbsp; For Mannhardt&rsquo;s method is
the reverse of that practised under the old colours to which he is said
to have returned.</p>
<h3>Mannhardt&rsquo;s Method</h3>
<p>&lsquo;My method is here the same as in the Tree-cult.&nbsp; I start
from a given collection of facts, of which the central idea is distinct
and generally admitted, and consequently offers a firm basis for explanation.&nbsp;
I illustrate from this and from well-founded analogies.&nbsp; Continuing
from these, I seek to elucidate darker things.&nbsp; I search out the
simplest radical ideas and perceptions, the germ-cells from whose combined
growth mythical tales form themselves in very different ways.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Frazer gives us a similar description of Mannhardt&rsquo;s method,
whether dealing with sun myths or tree myths. <a name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46">{46}</a>&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mannhardt set himself systematically to collect, compare, and
explain the living superstitions of the peasantry.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller has just confessed, as a reason for incompetence
to criticise Mannhardt&rsquo;s labours, &lsquo;my want of knowledge
of the materials with which he dealt&mdash;the popular customs and traditions
of Germany.&rsquo;&nbsp; And yet he asks where there is any difference
between his system and Mannhardt&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mannhardt&rsquo;s is
the study of rural survival, the system of folklore.&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
is the system of comparative philology about which in this place Mannhardt
does not say one single word.&nbsp; Mannhardt interprets some myths
&lsquo;arising from nature poetry, no longer intelligible to us,&rsquo;
by <i>analogies</i>; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller interprets them by <i>etymologies</i>.</p>
<p>The difference is incalculable; not that Mannhardt always abstains
from etymologising.</p>
<h3>Another Claim on Mannhardt</h3>
<p>While maintaining that &lsquo;all comparative mythology must rest
on comparison of names as its most certain basis&rsquo; (a system which
Mannhardt declares explicitly to be so far &lsquo;a failure&rsquo;),
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller says, &lsquo;It is well known that in his last,
nay posthumous essay, Mannhardt, no mean authority, returned to the
same conviction.&rsquo;&nbsp; I do not know which is Mannhardt&rsquo;s
very last essay, but I shall prove that in the posthumous essays Mannhardt
threw cold water on the whole method of philological comparative mythology.</p>
<p>However, as proof of Mannhardt&rsquo;s return to Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
convictions, our author cites <i>Mythologische</i> <i>Forschungen</i>
(pp. 86-113).</p>
<h3>What Mannhardt said</h3>
<p>In the passages here produced as proof of Mannhardt&rsquo;s conversion,
he is not investigating a myth at all, or a name which occurs in mythology.&nbsp;
He is trying to discover the meaning of the practices of the Lupercalia
at Rome.&nbsp; In February, says Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the Romans
held a popular festival, and lads ran round naked, save for skins of
victims, whipping the spectators.&nbsp; Mannhardt, in his usual way,
collects all the facts first, and then analyses the name <i>Luperci</i>.&nbsp;
This does not make him a philological mythologist.&nbsp; To take a case
in point, at Selkirk and Queensferry the bounds are ridden, or walked,
by &lsquo;Burleymen&rsquo; or &lsquo;Burrymen.&rsquo; <a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48">{48}</a>&nbsp;
After examining the facts we examine the words, and ask, &lsquo;Why
Burley or Burry men?&rsquo;&nbsp; At Queensferry, by a folk etymology,
one of the lads wears a coat stuck over with <i>burrs</i>.&nbsp; But
&lsquo;Borough-men&rsquo; seems the probable etymology.&nbsp; As we
examine the names Burley, or Burry men, so Mannhardt examines the name
<i>Luperci</i>; and if a true etymology can be discovered, it will illustrate
the original intention of the Lupercalia (p. 86).</p>
<p>He would like to explain the Lupercalia as a popular play, representing
the spirits of vegetation opposing the spirits of infertility.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But we do not forget that our whole theory of the development
of the rite rests on a hypothesis which the lack of materials prevents
us from demonstrating.&rsquo;&nbsp; He would explain <i>Luperci</i>
as <i>Lupiherci</i>&mdash;&lsquo;wolf-goats.&rsquo;&nbsp; Over this
we need not linger; but how does all this prove Mannhardt to have returned
to the method of comparing Greek with Vedic divine names, and arriving
thence at some celestial phenomenon as the basis of a terrestrial myth?&nbsp;
Yet he sometimes does this.</p>
<h3>My Relations to Mannhardt</h3>
<p>If anything could touch and move an unawakened anthropologist it
would be the conversion of Mannhardt.&nbsp; My own relations with his
ideas have the interest of illustrating mental coincidences.&nbsp; His
name does not occur, I think, in the essay, &lsquo;The Method of Folklore,&rsquo;
in the first edition of my <i>Custom</i> <i>and</i> <i>Myth</i>.&nbsp;
In that essay I take, as an example of the method, the Scottish and
Northumbrian <i>Kernababy</i>, the puppet made out of the last gleanings
of harvest.&nbsp; This I compared to the Greek Demeter of the harvest-home,
with sheaves and poppies in her hands, in the immortal Seventh Idyll
of Theocritus.&nbsp; Our Kernababy, I said, is a stunted survival of
our older &lsquo;Maiden,&rsquo; &lsquo;a regular image of the harvest
goddess,&rsquo; and I compared &kappa;&omicron;&rho;&eta;.&nbsp; Next
I gave the parallel case from ancient Peru, and the odd accidental coincidence
that <i>there</i> the maize was styled <i>Mama</i> <i>Cora</i> (&mu;&eta;&tau;&eta;&rho;
&kappa;&omicron;&rho;&eta;!).</p>
<p>In entire ignorance of Mannhardt&rsquo;s corn-spirit, or corn-mother,
I was following Mannhardt&rsquo;s track.&nbsp; Indeed, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
has somewhere remarked that I popularise Mannhardt&rsquo;s ideas.&nbsp;
Naturally he could not guess that the coincidence was accidental and
also inevitable.&nbsp; Two men, unknown to each other, were using the
same method on the same facts.</p>
<h3>Mannhardt&rsquo;s Return to his old Colours</h3>
<p>If, then, Mannhardt was re-converted, it would be a potent argument
for my conversion.&nbsp; But one is reminded of the re-conversion of
Prince Charles.&nbsp; In 1750 he &lsquo;deserted the errors of the Church
of Rome for those of the Church of England.&rsquo;&nbsp; Later he returned,
or affected to return, to the ancient faith.</p>
<p>A certain Cardinal seemed contented therewith, and, as the historian
remarks, &lsquo;was clearly a man not difficult to please.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller reminds me of the good Cardinal.&nbsp; I do not
feel so satisfied as he does of Mannhardt&rsquo;s re-conversion.</p>
<h3>Mannhardt&rsquo;s Attitude to Philology</h3>
<p>We have heard Mannhardt, in a letter partly cited by Mr. Max M&uuml;ller,
describe his own method.&nbsp; He begins with what is certain and intelligible,
a mass of popular customs.&nbsp; These he explains by analogies.&nbsp;
He passes from the known to the obscure.&nbsp; Philological mythologists
begin with the unknown, the name of a god.&nbsp; This they analyse,
extract a meaning, and (proceeding to the known) fit the facts of the
god&rsquo;s legend into the sense of his name.&nbsp; The methods are
each other&rsquo;s opposites, yet the letter in which Mannhardt illustrates
this fact is cited as a proof of his return to his old colours.</p>
<h3>Irritating Conduct of Mannhardt</h3>
<p>Nothing irritates philological mythologists so much, nothing has
injured them so much in the esteem of the public which &lsquo;goes into
these things a little,&rsquo; as the statement that their competing
etymologies and discrepant interpretations of mythical names are mutually
destructive.&nbsp; I have been told that this is &lsquo;a mean argument.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But if one chemical analyst found bismuth where another found iridium,
and a third found argon, the public would begin to look on chemistry
without enthusiasm; still more so if one chemist rarely found anything
but inevitable bismuth or omnipresent iridium.&nbsp; Now Mannhardt uses
this &lsquo;mean argument.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Mannhardt on Demeter Erinnys</h3>
<p>In a posthumous work, <i>Mythologische</i> <i>Forschungen</i> (1884),
the work from which Mr. Max M&uuml;ller cites the letter to M&uuml;llenhoff,
Mannhardt discusses Demeter Erinnys.&nbsp; She is the Arcadian goddess,
who, in the form of a mare, became mother of Despoina and the horse
Arion, by Poseidon. <a name="citation51a"></a><a href="#footnote51a">{51a}</a>&nbsp;
Her anger at the unhandsome behaviour of Poseidon caused Demeter to
be called Erinnys&mdash;&lsquo;to be angry&rsquo; being &epsilon;&rho;&iota;&nu;&upsilon;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;
in Arcadian&mdash;a folk-etymology, clearly.&nbsp; Mannhardt first dives
deep into the sources for this fable. <a name="citation51b"></a><a href="#footnote51b">{51b}</a>&nbsp;
Arion, he decides, is no mythological personification, but a poetical
ideal (<i>Bezeichnung</i>) of the war-horse.&nbsp; Legend is ransacked
for proof of this.&nbsp; Poseidon is the lord of wind and wave.&nbsp;
Now, there are waves of corn, under the wind, as well as waves of the
sea.&nbsp; When the Suabian rustic sees the wave running over the corn,
he says, <i>Da</i> <i>lauft</i> <i>das</i> <i>Pferd</i>, and Greeks
before Homer would say, in face of the billowing corn, &rsquo;&Epsilon;&kappa;&iota;&theta;&iota;
&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota; &iota;&pi;&pi;&omicron;&iota;,
<i>There</i> <i>run</i> <i>horses</i>!&nbsp; And Homer himself <a name="citation51c"></a><a href="#footnote51c">{51c}</a>
says that the horses of Erichthonius, children of Boreas, ran over cornfield
and sea.&nbsp; We ourselves speak of sea-waves as &lsquo;white horses.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So, to be brief, Mannhardt explains the myth of Demeter Erinnys becoming,
as a mare, a mother by Poseidon as a horse, thus, &lsquo;Poseidon Hippies,
or Poseidon in horse&rsquo;s form, rushes through the growing grain
and weds Demeter,&rsquo; and he cites peasant proverbs, such as <i>Das</i>
<i>Korn</i> <i>heirathet</i>; <i>das</i> <i>Korn</i> <i>feiert</i> <i>Hochzeit</i>
(p. 264).&nbsp; &lsquo;This is the germ of the Arcadian Saga.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The Arcadian myth of Demeter Erinnys is undeniably
a blending of the epic tradition [of the ideal war-horse] with the local
cult of Demeter. . . .&nbsp; It is a probable hypothesis that the belief
in the wedding of Demeter and Poseidon comes from the sight of the waves
passing over the cornfield. . . .&rsquo; <a name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52">{52}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very neat!&nbsp; But a certain myth of Loki in horse-form comes
into memory, and makes me wonder how Mannhardt would have dealt with
that too liberal narrative.</p>
<p>Loki, as a mare (he being a male god), became, by the horse of a
giant, the father of Sleipnir, Odin&rsquo;s eight-footed steed.&nbsp;
Mr. W. A. Craigie supplies this note on Loki&rsquo;s analogy with Poseidon,
as a horse, in the waves of corn:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;In North Jutland, when the vapours are seen going
with a wavy motion along the earth in the heat of summer, they say,
&ldquo;Loki is sowing oats today,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Loki is driving his
goats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;N.B.&mdash;<i>Oats</i> in Danish are <i>havre</i>, which suggests
O.N. <i>hafrar</i>, goats.&nbsp; Modern Icelandic has <i>hafrar</i>=oats,
but the word is not found in the old language.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is Loki a corn-spirit?</p>
<h3>Mannhardt&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mean Argument&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Mannhardt now examines the explanations of Demeter Erinnys, and her
legend, given by Preller, E. Curtius, O. M&uuml;ller, A. Kuhn, W. Sonne,
Max M&uuml;ller, E. Burnouf, de Gubernatis, Schwartz, and H. D. M&uuml;ller.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; he cries, &lsquo;is a variegated list of hypotheses!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Demeter is</p>
<blockquote><p>Storm-cloud<br />
Sun Goddess<br />
Earth and Moon Goddess<br />
Dawn<br />
Night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poseidon is</p>
<blockquote><p>Sea<br />
Storm God<br />
Cloud-hidden Sun<br />
Rain God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despoina is</p>
<blockquote><p>Rain<br />
Thunder<br />
Moon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arion, the horse, is</p>
<blockquote><p>Lightning<br />
Sun<br />
Thunder-horse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Erinnys is</p>
<blockquote><p>Storm-cloud<br />
Red Dawn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mannhardt decides, after this exhibition of guesses, that the Demeter
legends cannot be explained as refractions of any natural phenomena
in the heavens (p. 275).&nbsp; He concludes that the myth of Demeter
Erinnys, and the parallel Vedic story of Saranyu (who also had an amour
as a mare), are &lsquo;incongruous,&rsquo; and that neither sheds any
light on the other.&nbsp; He protests against the whole tendency to
find prototypes of all Aryan myths in the Veda, and to think that, with
a few exceptions, all mythology is a terrestrial reflection of celestial
phenomena (p. 280).&nbsp; He then goes into the contending etymologies
of Demeter, and decides (&lsquo;for the man was mortal and had been
a&rsquo; philologer) in favour of his own guess, &Zeta;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;
&delta;&eta;+&mu;&eta;&tau;&eta;&rho;<i>=</i>&lsquo;Corn-mother&rsquo;
(p. 294).</p>
<p>This essay on Demeter was written by Mannhardt in the summer of 1877,
a year after the letter which is given as evidence that he had &lsquo;returned
to his old colours.&rsquo;&nbsp; The essay shows him using the philological
string of &lsquo;variegated hypotheses&rsquo; as anything but an argument
in favour of the philological method.&nbsp; On the other hand, he warns
us against the habit, so common in the philological school, of looking
for prototypes of all Aryan myths in the Veda, and of finding in most
myths a reflection on earth of phenomena in the heavens, Erinnys being
either Storm-cloud or Dawn, according to the taste and fancy of the
inquirer.&nbsp; We also find Mannhardt, in 1877, starting from the known&mdash;legend
and rural survival in phrase and custom&mdash;and so advancing to the
unknown&mdash;the name Demeter.&nbsp; The philologists commence with
the unknown, the old name, Demeter Erinnys, explain it to taste, and
bring the legend into harmony with their explanation.&nbsp; I cannot
say, then, that I share Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s impression.&nbsp;
I do not feel sure that Mannhardt did return to his old colours.</p>
<h3>Why Mannhardt is Thought to have been Converted</h3>
<p>Mannhardt&rsquo;s friend, M&uuml;llenhoff, had an aversion to solar
myths.&nbsp; He said: <a name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54">{54}</a>
&lsquo;I deeply mistrust all these combinations of the new so-called
comparative mythology.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mannhardt was preparing to study
Lithuanian solar myths, based on Lithuanian and Lettish marriage songs.&nbsp;
M&uuml;llenhoff and Scherer seem to have thought this work too solar
for their taste.&nbsp; Mannhardt therefore replied to their objections
in the letter quoted in part by Mr. Max M&uuml;ller.&nbsp; Mannhardt
was not the man to neglect or suppress solar myths when he found them,
merely because he did not believe that a great many other myths which
had been claimed as celestial were solar.&nbsp; Like every sensible
person, he knew that there are numerous real, obvious, confessed solar
myths <i>not</i> derived from a disease of language.&nbsp; These arise
from (1) the impulse to account for the doings of the Sun by telling
a story about him as if he were a person; (2) from the natural poetry
of the human mind. <a name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55">{55}</a>&nbsp;
What we think they are <i>not</i> shown to arise from is forgetfulness
of meanings of old words, which, <i>ex</i> <i>hypothesi</i>, have become
proper names.</p>
<p>That is the theory of the philological school, and to that theory,
to these colours, I see no proof (in the evidence given) that Mannhardt
had returned.&nbsp; But &lsquo;the scalded child dreads cold water,&rsquo;
and M&uuml;llenhoff apparently dreaded even real solar myths.&nbsp;
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, on the other hand (if I do not misinterpret him),
supposes that Mannhardt had returned to the philological method, partly
because he was interested in <i>real</i> solar myths and in the natural
poetry of illiterate races.</p>
<h3>Mannhardt&rsquo;s Final Confession</h3>
<p>Mannhardt&rsquo;s last work published in his life days was <i>Antike</i>
<i>Wald</i>- <i>und</i> <i>Feldkulte</i> (1877).&nbsp; In the preface,
dated November 1, 1876 (<i>after</i> the famous letter of May 1876),
he explains the growth of his views and criticises his predecessors.&nbsp;
After doing justice to Kuhn and his comparisons of European with Indian
myths, he says that, in his opinion, comparative Indo-Germanic mythology
has not yet borne the expected fruits.&nbsp; &lsquo;The <i>assured</i>
gains shrink into very few divine names, such as Dyaus&mdash;Zeus&mdash;Tius,
Parjany&mdash;Perkunas, Bhaga&mdash;Bug, Varuna&mdash;Uranus, &amp;c.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I wish he had completed the list included in &amp;c.&nbsp; Other equations,
as Sarameya=Hermeias, Saranyu=Demeter Erinnys, he fears will not stand
close criticism.&nbsp; He dreads that <i>jeux</i> <i>d&rsquo;esprit</i>
(<i>geistvolle</i> <i>Spiele</i> <i>des</i> <i>Witzes</i>) may once
more encroach on science.&nbsp; Then, after a lucid statement of Mr.
Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s position, he says, &lsquo;Ich vermag dem von
M. M&uuml;ller aufgestellten Principe, wenn &uuml;berhaupt eine, so
doch nur eine sehr beschrankte Geltung zuzugestehen.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;To the principle of Max M&uuml;ller I can only
assign a very limited value, if any value at all.&rsquo; <a name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56">{56}</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Taken all in all, I consider the greater part of the results
hitherto obtained in the field of Indo-Germanic comparative mythology
to be, as yet, a failure, premature or incomplete, my own efforts in
<i>German</i> <i>Myths</i> (1858) included.&nbsp; That I do not, however,
&ldquo;throw out the babe with the bath,&rdquo; as the proverb goes,
my essay on Lettish sun myths in Bastian-Hartmann&rsquo;s <i>Ethnological</i>
<i>Journal</i> will bear witness.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is Mannhardt&rsquo;s conclusion.&nbsp; Taken in connection with
his still later essay on Demeter, it really leaves no room for doubt.&nbsp;
There, I think, he does &lsquo;throw out the child with the bath,&rsquo;
throw the knife after the handle.&nbsp; I do not suppose that Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller ever did quote Mannhardt as one of his supporters, but such
a claim, if really made, would obviously give room for criticism.</p>
<h3>Mannhardt on Solar Myths</h3>
<p>What the attitude of Mannhardt was, in 1877 and later, we have seen.&nbsp;
He disbelieves in the philological system of explaining myths by etymological
conjectures.&nbsp; He disbelieves in the habit of finding, in myths
of terrestrial occurrences, reflections of celestial phenomena.&nbsp;
But earlier, in his long essay <i>Die</i> <i>lettischen</i> <i>Sonnenmythen</i>
(in <i>Zeitschrift</i> <i>f&uuml;r</i> <i>Ethnologie</i>, 1875), he
examines the Lettish popular songs about the Sun, the Sun&rsquo;s daughters,
the god-sons, and so forth.&nbsp; Here, of course, he is dealing with
popular songs explicitly devoted to solar phenomena, in their poetical
aspect.&nbsp; In the Lettish Sun-songs and Sun-myths of the peasants
we see, he says, a myth-world &lsquo;in process of becoming,&rsquo;
in an early state of development, as in <i>the</i> <i>Veda</i> (p. 325).&nbsp;
But, we may reply, in the Veda, myths are already full-grown, or even
decadent.&nbsp; Already there are unbelievers in the myths.&nbsp; Thus
we would say, in the Veda we have (1) myths of nature, formed in the
remote past, and (2) poetical phrases about heavenly phenomena, which
resemble the nature-poetry of the Letts, but which do not become full-grown
myths.&nbsp; The Lett songs, also, have not developed into myths, of
which (as in the Apollo and Daphne story, by Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
hypothesis) <i>the</i> <i>original</i> <i>meaning</i> <i>is</i> <i>lost</i>.</p>
<p>In the Lett songs we have a mass of nature-pictures&mdash;the boat
and the apples of the Sun, the red cloak hung on the oak-tree, and so
on; pictures by which it is sought to make elemental phenomena intelligible,
by comparison with familiar things.&nbsp; Behind the phenomena are,
in popular belief, personages&mdash;mythical personages&mdash;the Sun
as &lsquo;a magnified non-natural man,&rsquo; or woman; the Sun&rsquo;s
mother, daughters, and other heavenly people.&nbsp; Their conduct is
&lsquo;motived&rsquo; in a human way.&nbsp; Stories are told about them:
the Sun kills the Moon, who revives.</p>
<p>All this is perfectly familiar everywhere.&nbsp; Savages, in their
fables, account for solar, lunar, and similar elemental processes, on
the theory that the heavenly bodies are, and act like, human beings.&nbsp;
The Eskimo myth of the spots on the Moon, marks of ashes thrown by the
Sun in a love-quarrel, is an excellent example.&nbsp; But in all this
there is no &lsquo;disease of language.&rsquo;&nbsp; These are frank
nature-myths, &lsquo;&aelig;tiological,&rsquo; giving a fabulous reason
for facts of nature.</p>
<h3>Mannhardt on M&auml;rchen.</h3>
<p>But Mannhardt goes farther.&nbsp; He not only recognises, as everyone
must do, the Sun, as explicitly named, when he plays his part in myth,
or popular tale (<i>M&auml;rchen</i>).&nbsp; He thinks that even when
the Sun is not named, his presence, and reference to him, and derivation
of the incidents in <i>M&auml;rchen</i> from solar myth, may sometimes
be detected with great probability (pp. 326, 327).&nbsp; But he adds,
&lsquo;not that every <i>M&auml;rchen</i> contains a reference to Nature;
that I am far from asserting&rsquo; (p. 327).</p>
<p>Now perhaps nobody will deny that some incidents in <i>M&auml;rchen</i>
may have been originally suggested by nature-myths.&nbsp; The all-swallowing
and all-disgorging beast, wolf, or ogre, may have been derived from
a view of Night as the all-swallower.&nbsp; But to disengage natural
phenomena, mythically stated, from the human tangle of <i>M&auml;rchen</i>,
to find natural phenomena in such a palimpsest as Perrault&rsquo;s courtly
and artificial version of a French popular tale, is a delicate and dangerous
task.&nbsp; In many stories a girl has three balls&mdash;one of silver,
one of gold, one of diamond&mdash;which she offers, in succession, as
bribes.&nbsp; This is a perfectly natural invention.&nbsp; It is perilous
to connect these balls, gifts of ascending value, with the solar apple
of iron, silver, and gold (p. 103 and note 5).&nbsp; It is perilous,
and it is quite unnecessary.&nbsp; Some one&mdash;Gubernatis, I think&mdash;has
explained the naked sword of Aladdin, laid between him and the Sultan&rsquo;s
daughter in bed, as the silver sickle of the Moon.&nbsp; Really the
sword has an obvious purpose and meaning, and is used as a symbol in
proxy-marriages.&nbsp; The blood shed by Achilles in his latest victories
is elsewhere explained as red clouds round the setting Sun, which is
conspicuously childish.&nbsp; Mannhardt leans, at least, in this direction.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;The Two Brothers&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Mannhardt takes the old Egyptian tale of &lsquo;The Two Brothers,&rsquo;
Bitiou and Anepou.&nbsp; This fable, as old, in actual written literature,
as Moses, is a complex of half the <i>M&auml;rchen</i> plots and incidents
in the world.&nbsp; It opens with the formula of Potiphar&rsquo;s Wife.&nbsp;
The falsely accused brother flies, and secretes his life, or separable
soul, in a flower of the mystic Vale of Acacias.&nbsp; This affair of
the separable soul may be studied in Mr. Hartland&rsquo;s <i>Perseus</i>,
and it animates, as we shall see, Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s theory of the Origin
of Totemism.&nbsp; A golden lock of the wicked wife&rsquo;s hair is
then borne by the Nile to the king&rsquo;s palace in Egypt.&nbsp; He
will insist on marrying the lady of the lock.&nbsp; Here we are in the
Cinderella formula, <i>en</i> <i>plein</i>, which may be studied, in
African and Santhal shapes, in Miss Coxe&rsquo;s valuable <i>Cinderella</i>.
<a name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60">{60}</a>&nbsp; Pharaoh&rsquo;s
wise men decide that the owner of the lock of hair is (like Egyptian
royalty at large) a daughter of the Sun-god (p. 239).&nbsp; Here is
the Sun, in all his glory; but here we are dealing with a literary version
of the <i>M&auml;rchen</i>, accommodated to royal tastes and Egyptian
ideas of royalty by a royal scribe, the courtly Perrault of the Egyptian
<i>Roi</i>-<i>Soleil</i>.&nbsp; Who can say what he introduced?&mdash;while
we <i>can</i> say that the Sun-god is absent in South African and Santhal
and other variants.&nbsp; The Sun may have slipped out here, may have
been slipped in there; the faintest glimmer of the historical sense
prevents us from dogmatising.</p>
<p>Wedded to Pharaoh, the wicked wife, pursuing her vengeance on Bitiou,
cuts down his life-tree.&nbsp; Anepou, his brother, however, recovers
his concealed heart (life), and puts it in water.&nbsp; Bitiou revives.&nbsp;
He changes himself into the sacred Bull, Apis&mdash;a feature in the
story which is practically possible in Egypt alone.&nbsp; The Bull tells
the king his story, but the wicked wife has the Bull slain, as by Cambyses
in Herodotus.&nbsp; Two of his blood-drops become two persea trees.&nbsp;
One of them confesses the fact to the wicked wife.&nbsp; She has them
cut down; a chip flies into her mouth, she becomes a mother by the chip,
the boy (Bitiou) again becomes king, and slays his mother, the wicked
wife.</p>
<p>In the tree, any tree, acacia or persea, Mannhardt wishes to recognise
the Sun-tree of the Lett songs.&nbsp; The red blossoms of the persea
tree are a symbol of the Sun-tree: of Horus.&nbsp; He compares features,
not always very closely analogous, in European <i>M&auml;rchen</i>.&nbsp;
For example, a girl hides in a tree, like Charles II. at Boscobel.&nbsp;
That is not really analogous with Bitiou&rsquo;s separable life in the
acacia!&nbsp; &lsquo;Anepou&rsquo; is like &lsquo;Anapu,&rsquo; Anubis.&nbsp;
The Bull is the Sun, is Osiris&mdash;dead in winter.&nbsp; Mr. Frazer,
Mannhardt&rsquo;s disciple, protests <i>&agrave;</i> <i>grands</i> <i>cris</i>
against these identifications when made by others than Mannhardt, who
says, &lsquo;The <i>M&auml;rchen</i> is an old obscure solar myth&rsquo;
(p. 242).&nbsp; To others the story of Bitiou seems an Egyptian literary
complex, based on a popular set of tales illustrating <i>furens</i>
<i>quid</i> <i>femina</i> <i>possit</i>, and illustrating the world-wide
theory of the separable life, dragging in formulas from other <i>M&auml;rchen</i>,
and giving to all a thoroughly classical Egyptian colouring. <a name="citation61a"></a><a href="#footnote61a">{61a}</a>&nbsp;
Solar myths, we think, have not necessarily anything to make in the
matter.</p>
<h3>The Golden Fleece</h3>
<p>Mannhardt reasons in much the same way about the Golden Fleece.&nbsp;
This is a peculiarly Greek feature, interwoven with the world-wide <i>M&auml;rchen</i>
of the Lad, the Giant&rsquo;s helpful daughter, her aid in accomplishing
feats otherwise impossible, and the pursuit of the pair by the father.&nbsp;
I have studied the story&mdash;as it occurs in Samoa, among Red Indian
tribes, and elsewhere&mdash;in &lsquo;A Far-travelled Tale.&rsquo; <a name="citation61b"></a><a href="#footnote61b">{61b}</a>&nbsp;
In our late Greek versions the Quest of the Fleece of Gold occurs, but
in no other variants known to me.&nbsp; There is a lamb (a boy changed
into a lamb) in Romaic.&nbsp; His fleece is of no interest to anybody.&nbsp;
Out of his body grows a tree with a golden apple.&nbsp; Sun-yarns occur
in popular songs.&nbsp; Mannhardt (pp. 282, 283) abounds in solar explanations
of the Fleece of Gold, hanging on the oak-tree in the dark &AElig;&aelig;an
forest.&nbsp; Idyia, wife of the Colchian king, &lsquo;is clearly the
Dawn.&rsquo;&nbsp; Aia is the isle of the Sun.&nbsp; Helle=Surya, a
Sanskrit Sun-goddess; the golden ram off whose back she falls, while
her brother keeps his seat, is the Sun.&nbsp; Her brother, Phrixus,
may be the Daylight.&nbsp; The oak-tree in Colchis is the Sun-tree of
the Lettish songs.&nbsp; Perseus is a hero of Light, born in the Dark
Tower (Night) from the shower of gold (Sun-rays).</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can but say &ldquo;it may be so,&rdquo;&rsquo; but who
could explain all the complex Perseus-saga as a statement about elemental
phenomena?&nbsp; Or how can the Far-travelled Tale of the Lad and the
Giant&rsquo;s Daughter be interpreted to the same effect, above all
in the countless examples where no Fleece of Gold occurs?&nbsp; The
Greek tale of Jason is made up of several <i>M&auml;rchen</i>, as is
the Odyssey, by epic poets.&nbsp; These <i>M&auml;rchen</i> have no
necessary connection with each other; they are tagged on to each other,
and localised in Greece and on the Euxine. <a name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a">{62a}</a>&nbsp;
A poetic popular view of the Sun may have lent the peculiar, and elsewhere
absent, incident of the quest of the Fleece of Gold on the shores of
the Black Sea.&nbsp; The old epic poets may have borrowed from popular
songs like the Lettish chants (p. 328).&nbsp; A similar dubious adhesion
may be given by us in the case of Castor and Polydeuces (Morning and
Evening Stars?), and Helen (Dawn), <a name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b">{62b}</a>
and the Hesperides (p. 234).&nbsp; The germs of the myths <i>may</i>
be popular poetical views of elemental phenomena.&nbsp; But to insist
on elemental allegories through all the legends of the Dioskouroi, and
of the Trojan war, would be to strain a hypothesis beyond the breaking-point.&nbsp;
Much, very much, is epic invention, <i>unverkennbar</i> <i>das</i> <i>werk</i>
<i>der</i> <i>Dichter</i> (p. 328).</p>
<h3>Mannhardt&rsquo;s Approach to Mr. Max M&uuml;ller</h3>
<p>In this essay on Lettish Sun-songs (1875) Mannhardt comes nearest
to Mr. Max M&uuml;ller.&nbsp; He cites passages from him with approval
(<i>cf</i>. pp. 314, 322).&nbsp; His explanations, by aid of Sun-songs,
of certain features in Greek mythology are plausible, and may be correct.&nbsp;
But we turn to Mannhardt&rsquo;s explicit later statement of his own
position in 1877, and to his posthumous essays, published in 1884; and,
on the whole, we find, in my opinion, much more difference from than
agreement with the Oxford Professor, whose Dawn-Daphne and other equations
Mannhardt dismisses, and to whose general results (in mythology) he
assigns a value so restricted.&nbsp; It is a popular delusion that the
anthropological mythologists deny the existence of solar myths, or of
nature-myths in general.&nbsp; These are extremely common.&nbsp; What
we demur to is the explanation of divine and heroic myths at large as
solar or elemental, when the original sense has been lost by the ancient
narrators, and when the elemental explanation rests on conjectural and
conflicting etymologies and interpretations of old proper names&mdash;Athene,
Hera, Artemis, and the rest.&nbsp; Nevertheless, while Mannhardt, in
his works on Tree-cult, and on Field and Wood Cult, and on the &lsquo;Corn
Demon,&rsquo; has wandered far from &lsquo;his old colours&rsquo;&mdash;while
in his posthumous essays he is even more of a deserter, his essay on
Lettish Sun-myths shows an undeniable tendency to return to Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s camp.&nbsp; This was what made his friends so anxious.&nbsp;
It is probably wisest to form our opinion of his final attitude on his
preface to his last book published in his life-time.&nbsp; In that the
old colours are not exactly his chosen banner; nor can the flag of the
philological school be inscribed <i>tandem</i> <i>triumphans</i>.</p>
<p>In brief, Mannhardt&rsquo;s return to his old colours (1875-76) seems
to have been made in a mood from which he again later passed away.&nbsp;
But either modern school of mythology may cite him as an ally in one
or other of his phases of opinion.</p>
<h2>PHILOLOGY AND DEMETER ERINNYS</h2>
<h3>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller on Demeter Erinnys.</h3>
<p>Like Mannhardt, our author in his new treatise discusses the strange
old Arcadian myth of the horse-Demeter Erinnys (ii. 537).&nbsp; He tells
the unseemly tale, and asks why the Earth goddess became a mare?&nbsp;
Then he gives the analogous myth from the Rig-Veda, <a name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65">{65}</a>
which, as it stands, is &lsquo;quite unintelligible.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
Y&acirc;ska explains that Saranyu, daughter of Tvashtri, in the form
of a mare, had twins by Vivasvat, in the shape of a stallion.&nbsp;
Their offspring were the Asvins, who are more or less analogous in their
helpful character to Castor and Pollux.&nbsp; Now, can it be by accident
that Saranyu in the Veda is Erinnys in Greek?&nbsp; To this &lsquo;equation,&rsquo;
as we saw, Mannhardt demurred in 1877.&nbsp; Who was Saranyu?&nbsp;
Y&acirc;ska says &lsquo;the Night;&rsquo; that was Y&acirc;ska&rsquo;s
idea.&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller adds, &lsquo;I think he is right,&rsquo;
and that Saranyu is &lsquo;the grey dawn&rsquo; (ii. 541).</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; the bewildered reader exclaims, &lsquo;Dawn is
one thing and Night is quite another.&rsquo;&nbsp; So Y&acirc;ska himself
was intelligent enough to observe, &lsquo;Night is the wife of Aditya;
she vanishes at sunrise.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, Night in Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
system &lsquo;has just got to be&rsquo; Dawn, a position proved thus:
&lsquo;Y&acirc;ska makes this clear by saying that the time of the Asvins,
sons of Saranyu, is after midnight,&rsquo; but that &lsquo;when darkness
prevails over light, that is Madhyama; when light prevails over darkness,
that is Aditya,&rsquo; both being Asvins.&nbsp; They (the Asvins) are,
in fact, darkness and light; and <i>therefore</i>, I understand, Saranyu,
who is Night, and not an Asvin at all, is Dawn!&nbsp; To make this perfectly
clear, remember that the husband of Saranyu, whom she leaves at sunrise,
is&mdash;I give you three guesses&mdash;is the Sun!&nbsp; The Sun&rsquo;s
wife leaves the Sun at sunrise. <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66">{66}</a>&nbsp;
This is proved, for Aditya is Vivasvat=the Sun, and is the husband of
Saranyu (ii. 541).&nbsp; These methods of proving Night to be Dawn,
while the substitute for both in the bed of the Sun &lsquo;may have
been meant for the gloaming&rsquo; (ii. 542), do seem to be <i>geistvolle</i>
<i>Spiele</i> <i>des</i> <i>Witzes</i>, ingenious <i>jeux</i> <i>d&rsquo;esprit</i>,
as Mannhardt says, rather than logical arguments.</p>
<p>But we still do not know how the horse and mare came in, or why the
statue of Demeter had a horse&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; &lsquo;This seems
simply to be due to the fact that, quite apart from this myth, the sun
had, in India at least, often been conceived as a horse . . . . and
the dawn had been likened to a mare.&rsquo;&nbsp; But how does this
explain the problem?&nbsp; The Vedic poets cited (ii. 542) either referred
to the myth which we have to explain, or they used a poetical expression,
knowing perfectly well what they meant.&nbsp; As long as they knew what
they meant, they could not make an unseemly fable out of a poetical
phrase.&nbsp; Not till after the meaning was forgotten could the myth
arise.&nbsp; But the myth existed already in the Veda!&nbsp; And the
unseemliness is precisely what we have to account for; that is our enigma.</p>
<p>Once more, Demeter is a goddess of Earth, not of Dawn.&nbsp; How,
then, does the explanation of a hypothetical Dawn-myth apply to the
Earth?&nbsp; Well, perhaps the story, the unseemly story, was first
told of Erinnys (who also is &lsquo;the inevitable Dawn&rsquo;) or of
Deo, &lsquo;and this name of Deo, or Dy&acirc;v&acirc;, was mixed up
with a hypokoristic form of Demeter, Deo, and thus led to the transference
of her story to Demeter.&nbsp; I know this will sound very unlikely
to Greek scholars, yet I see no other way out of our difficulties&rsquo;
(ii. 545).&nbsp; Phonetic explanations follow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To my mind,&rsquo; says our author, &lsquo;there is no chapter
in mythology in which we can so clearly read the transition of an auroral
myth of the Veda into an epic chapter of Greece as in the chapter of
Saranyu (or Suram&acirc;) and the Asvins, ending in the chapter of Helena
and her brothers, the &Delta;&iota;&omicron;&sigma;&kappa;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&iota;
&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&kappa;&omicron;&pi;&omega;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;&rsquo;
(ii. 642).&nbsp; Here, as regards the Asvins and the Dioskouroi, Mannhardt
may be regarded as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s ally; but compare his
note, <i>A</i>. <i>F</i>. <i>u</i>. <i>W</i>. <i>K</i>. p. xx.</p>
<h3>My Theory of the Horse Demeter</h3>
<p>Mannhardt, I think, ought to have tried at an explanation of myths
so closely analogous as those two, one Indian, one Greek, in which a
goddess, in the shape of a mare, becomes mother of twins by a god in
the form of a stallion.&nbsp; As Mr. Max M&uuml;ller well says, &lsquo;If
we look about for analogies we find nothing, as far as I know, corresponding
to the well-marked features of this barbarous myth among any of the
uncivilised tribes of the earth.&nbsp; If we did, how we should rejoice!&nbsp;
Why, then, should we not rejoice when we find the allusion in Rig Veda?&rsquo;
(x 17, 1).</p>
<p>I do rejoice!&nbsp; The &lsquo;song of triumph,&rsquo; as Professor
Tiele says, will be found in <i>M</i>. <i>R</i>. <i>R</i>. ii. 266 (note),
where I give the Vedic and other references.&nbsp; I even asked why
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller did not produce this proof of the identity of Saranyu
and Demeter Erinnys in his <i>Selected</i> <i>Essays</i> (pp. 401, 492).</p>
<p>I cannot explain why this tale was told both of Erinnys and of Saranyu.&nbsp;
Granting the certainty of the etymological equation, Saranyu=Erinnys
(which Mannhardt doubted), the chances against fortuitous coincidence
may be reckoned by algebra, and Mr. Edgeworth&rsquo;s trillions of trillions
feebly express it.&nbsp; Two goddesses, Indian and Greek, have, <i>ex</i>
<i>hypothesi</i>, the same name, and both, as mares, are mothers of
twins.&nbsp; Though the twins (in India the Asvins, in Greek an ideal
war-horse and a girl) differ in character, still the coincidence is
evidential.&nbsp; Explain it I cannot, and, clearly as the confession
may prove my lack of scientific exactness, I make it candidly.</p>
<p>If I must offer a guess, it is that Greeks, and Indians of India,
inherited a very ordinary savage idea.&nbsp; The gods in savage myths
are usually beasts.&nbsp; As beasts they beget anthropomorphic offspring.&nbsp;
This is the regular rule in totemism.&nbsp; In savage myths we are not
told &lsquo;a god&rsquo; (Apollo, or Zeus, or Poseidon) &lsquo;put on
beast shape and begat human sons and daughters&rsquo; (Helen, the Telmisseis,
and so on).&nbsp; The god in savage myths was a beast already, though
he could, of course, shift shapes like any &lsquo;medicine-man,&rsquo;
or modern witch who becomes a hare.&nbsp; This is not the exception
but the rule in savage mythology.&nbsp; Anyone can consult my <i>Myth</i>,
<i>Ritual</i>, <i>and</i> <i>Religion</i>, or Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s work
<i>Totemism</i>, for abundance of evidence.&nbsp; To Loki, a male god,
prosecuting his amours as a female horse, I have already alluded, and
in <i>M</i>. <i>R</i>. <i>R</i>. give cases from the <i>Satapatha</i>
<i>Brahmana</i>.</p>
<p>The Saranyu-Erinnys myth dates, I presume, from this savage state
of fancy; but why the story occurred both in Greece and India, I protest
that I cannot pretend to explain, except on the hypothesis that the
ancestors of Greek and Vedic peoples once dwelt together, had a common
stock of savage fables, and a common or kindred language.&nbsp; After
their dispersion, the fables admitted discrepancies, as stories in oral
circulation occasionally do.&nbsp; This is the only conjecture which
I feel justified in suggesting to account for the resemblances and incongruities
between the myths of the mare Demeter-Erinnys and the mare Saranyu.</p>
<h2>TOTEMISM</h2>
<h3>Totemism</h3>
<p>To the strange and widely diffused institution of &lsquo;Totemism&rsquo;
our author often returns.&nbsp; I shall deal here with his collected
remarks on the theme, the more gladly as the treatment shows how very
far Mr. Max M&uuml;ller is from acting with a shadow of unfairness when
he does not refer to special passages in his opponent&rsquo;s books.&nbsp;
He treats himself and his own earlier works in the same fashion, thereby,
perhaps, weakening his argument, but also demonstrating his candour,
were any such demonstration required.</p>
<p>On totems he opens (i. 7)&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we come to special cases we must not imagine that much
can be gained by using such general terms as Animism, Totemism, Fetishism,
&amp;c., as solvents of mythological problems.&nbsp; To my mind, all
such general terms, not excluding even Darwinism or Puseyism, seem most
objectionable, because they encourage vague thought, vague praise, or
vague blame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is, for instance, quite possible to place all worship of
animal gods, all avoidance of certain kinds of animal food, all adoption
of animal names as the names of men and families, under the wide and
capacious cover of totemism.&nbsp; All theriolatry would thus be traced
back to totemism.&nbsp; I am not aware, however, that any Egyptologists
have adopted such a view to account for the animal forms of the Egyptian
gods.&nbsp; Sanskrit scholars would certainly hesitate before seeing
in Indra a totem because he is called v<i>ri</i>shabha, or bull, or
before attempting to explain on this ground the abstaining from beef
on the part of orthodox Hindus [i. 7].&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Totemism Defined</h3>
<p>I think I have defined totemism, <a name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71">{71}</a>
and the reader may consult Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s work on the subject, or
Mr. MacLennan&rsquo;s essays, or &lsquo;Totemism&rsquo; in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>
<i>Britannica</i>.&nbsp; However, I shall define totemism once more.&nbsp;
It is a state of society and cult, found most fully developed in Australia
and North America, in which sets of persons, believing themselves to
be akin by blood, call each such set by the name of some plant, beast,
or other class of objects in nature.&nbsp; One kin may be wolves, another
bears, another cranes, and so on.&nbsp; Each kin derives its kin-name
from its beast, plant, or what not; pays to it more or less respect,
usually abstains from killing, eating, or using it (except in occasional
sacrifices); is apt to claim descent from or relationship with it, and
sometimes uses its effigy on memorial pillars, carved pillars outside
huts, tattooed on the skin, and perhaps in other ways not known to me.&nbsp;
In Australia and North America, where rules are strict, a man may not
marry a woman of his own totem; and kinship is counted through mothers
in many, but not in all, cases.&nbsp; Where all these notes are combined
we have totemism.&nbsp; It is plain that two or three notes of it may
survive where the others have perished; may survive in ritual and sacrifice,
<a name="citation72a"></a><a href="#footnote72a">{72a}</a> and in bestial
or semi-bestial gods of certain nomes, or districts, in ancient Egypt;
<a name="citation72b"></a><a href="#footnote72b">{72b}</a> in Pictish
names; <a name="citation72c"></a><a href="#footnote72c">{72c}</a> in
claims of descent from beasts, or gods in the shape of beasts; in the
animals sacred to gods, as Apollo or Artemis, and so on.&nbsp; Such
survivals are possible enough in evolution, but the evidence needs careful
examination.&nbsp; Animal attributes and symbols and names in religion
are not necessarily totemistic.&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller asks if &lsquo;any
Egyptologists have adopted&rsquo; the totem theory.&nbsp; He is apparently
oblivious of Professor Sayce&rsquo;s reference to a prehistoric age,
&lsquo;when the religious creed of Egypt was still totemism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Codrington is next cited for the apparent absence of totemism
in the Solomon Islands and Polynesia, and Professor Oldenberg as denying
that &lsquo;animal names of persons and clans [necessarily?] imply totemism.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Who says that they do?&nbsp; &lsquo;Clan Chattan,&rsquo; with its cat
crest, may be based, not on a totem, but on a popular etymology.&nbsp;
Animal names of <i>individuals</i> have nothing to do with totems.&nbsp;
A man has no business to write on totemism if he does not know these
facts.</p>
<h3>What a Totem is</h3>
<p>Though our adversary now abandons totems, he returns to them elsewhere
(i. 198-202).&nbsp; &lsquo;Totem is the corruption of a term used by
North American Indians in the sense of clan-mark or sign-board (&ldquo;ododam&rdquo;).&rsquo;&nbsp;
The totem was originally a rude emblem of an animal or other object
&lsquo;placed by North American Indians in front of their settlements.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>The Evidence for Sign-boards</h3>
<p>Our author&rsquo;s evidence for sign-boards is from an Ottawa Indian,
and is published from his MS. by Mr. Hoskyns Abrahall. <a name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73">{73}</a>&nbsp;
The testimony is of the greatest merit, for it appears to have first
seen the light in a Canadian paper of 1858.&nbsp; Now in 1858 totems
were only spoken of in Lafitau, Long, and such old writers, and in Cooper&rsquo;s
novels.&nbsp; They had not become subjects of scientific dispute, so
the evidence is uncontaminated by theory.&nbsp; The Indians were, we
learn, divided into [local?] tribes, and these &lsquo;into sections
or families according to their <i>ododams</i>&rsquo;&mdash;devices,
signs, in modern usage &lsquo;coats of arms.&rsquo;&nbsp; [Perhaps &lsquo;crests&rsquo;
would be a better word.]&nbsp; All people of one <i>ododam</i> (apparently
under male kinship) lived together in a special section of each village.&nbsp;
At the entrance to the enclosure was the figure of an animal, or some
other sign, set up on the top of one of the posts.&nbsp; Thus everybody
knew what family dwelt in what section of the village.&nbsp; Some of
the families were called after their <i>ododam</i>.&nbsp; But the family
with the bear <i>ododam</i> were called Big Feet, not Bears.&nbsp; Sometimes
parts of different animals were &lsquo;quartered&rsquo; [my suggestion],
and one <i>ododam</i> was a small hawk and the fins of a sturgeon.</p>
<p>We cannot tell, of course, on the evidence here, whether &lsquo;Big
Feet&rsquo; suggested &lsquo;Bear,&rsquo; or <i>vice</i> <i>versa</i>,
or neither.&nbsp; But Mr. Frazer has remarked that periphrases for sacred
beasts, like &lsquo;Big Feet&rsquo; for Bear, are not uncommon.&nbsp;
Nor can we tell &lsquo;what couple of ancestors&rsquo; a small hawk
and a sturgeon&rsquo;s fins represent, unless, perhaps, a hawk and a
sturgeon. <a name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a">{74a}</a></p>
<p>For all this, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller suggests the explanation that people
who marked their abode with crow or wolf might come to be called Wolves
or Crows. <a name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b">{74b}</a>&nbsp;
Again, people might borrow beast names from the prevalent beast of their
district, as Arkades, &Alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&iota;, Bears,
and so evolve the myth of descent from Callisto as a she-bear.&nbsp;
&lsquo;All this, however, is only guesswork.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Snake
Indians worship no snake.&nbsp; [The Snake Indians are not a totem group,
but a local tribe named from the Snake River, as we say, &lsquo;An Ettrick
man.&rsquo;]&nbsp; Once more, the name-giving beast, say, &lsquo;Great
Hare,&rsquo; is explained by Dr. Brinton as &lsquo;the inevitable Dawn.&rsquo;
<a name="citation74c"></a><a href="#footnote74c">{74c}</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;Hasty
writers,&rsquo; remarks Dr. Brinton, &lsquo;say that the Indians claim
descent from different wild beasts.&rsquo;&nbsp; For evidence I refer
to that hasty writer, Mr. Frazer, and his book, <i>Totemism</i>.&nbsp;
For a newly sprung up modern totem our author alludes to a boat, among
the Mandans, &lsquo;their totem, or tutelary object of worship.&rsquo;&nbsp;
An object of worship, of course, is not necessarily a totem!&nbsp; Nor
is a totem by the definition (as a rule one of a <i>class</i> of objects)
anything but a <i>natural</i> object.&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller wishes
that &lsquo;those who write about totems and totemism would tell us
exactly what they mean by these words.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have told him,
and indicated better sources.&nbsp; I apply the word totemism to the
widely diffused savage institution which I have defined.</p>
<h3>More about Totems</h3>
<p>The origin of totemism is unknown to me, as to Mr. McLennan and Dr.
Robertson Smith, but Mr. Max M&uuml;ller knows this origin.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
totem is a clan-mark, then a clan-name, then the name of the ancestor
of a clan, and lastly the name of something worshipped by a clan&rsquo;
(i. 201).&nbsp; &lsquo;All this applies in the first instance to Red
Indians only.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes, and &lsquo;clan&rsquo; applies in the
first instance to the Scottish clans only!&nbsp; When Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
speaks of &lsquo;clans&rsquo; among the Red Indians, he uses a word
whose connotation differs from anything known to exist in America.&nbsp;
But the analogy between a Scottish clan and an American totem-kin is
close enough to justify Mr. Max M&uuml;ller in speaking of Red Indian
&lsquo;clans.&rsquo;&nbsp; By parity of reasoning, the analogy between
the Australian <i>Kobong</i> and the American totem is so complete that
we may speak of &lsquo;Totemism&rsquo; in Australia.&nbsp; It would
be childish to talk of &lsquo;Totemism&rsquo; in North America, &lsquo;Kobongism&rsquo;
in Australia, &lsquo;Pacarissaism&rsquo; in the realm of the Incas:
totems, kobongs, and pacarissas all amounting to the same thing, except
in one point.&nbsp; I am not aware that Australian blacks erect, or
that the subjects of the Incas, or that African and Indian and Asiatic
totemists, erected &lsquo;sign-boards&rsquo; anywhere, as the Ottawa
writer assures us that the Ottawas do, or used to do.&nbsp; And, if
they don&rsquo;t, how do we know that kobongs and pacarissas were developed
out of sign-boards?</p>
<h3>Heraldry and Totems</h3>
<p>The Ottawas are <i>armigeri</i>, are heraldic; so are the natives
of Vancouver&rsquo;s Island, who have wooden pillars with elaborate
quarterings.&nbsp; Examples are in South Kensington Museum.&nbsp; But
this savage heraldry is not nearly so common as the institution of totemism.&nbsp;
Thus it is difficult to prove that the heraldry is the origin of totemism,
which is just as likely, or more likely, to have been the origin of
savage heraldic crests and quarterings.&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller allows
that there may be other origins.</p>
<h3>Gods and Totems</h3>
<p>Our author refers to unnamed writers who call Indra or Ammon a totem
(i. 200).</p>
<p>This is a foolish liberty with language.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why should
not all the gods of Egypt with their heads of bulls and apes and cats
be survivals of totemisms?&rsquo;&nbsp; Why not, indeed?&nbsp; Professor
Sayce remarks, &lsquo;They were the sacred animals of the clans,&rsquo;
survivals from an age &lsquo;when the religion of Egypt was totemism.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;In Egypt the gods themselves are totem-deities, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>.
personifications or individual representations of the sacred character
and attributes which in the purely totem stage of religion were ascribed
without distinction to all animals of the holy kind.&rsquo;&nbsp; So
says Dr. Robertson Smith.&nbsp; He and Mr. Sayce are &lsquo;scholars,&rsquo;
not mere unscholarly anthropologists. <a name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76">{76}</a></p>
<h3>An Objection</h3>
<p>Lastly (ii. 403), when totems infected &lsquo;even those who ought
to have been proof against this infantile complaint&rsquo; (which is
not even a &lsquo;disease of language&rsquo; of a respectable type),
then &lsquo;the objection that a totem meant originally a clan-mark
was treated as scholastic pedantry.&rsquo;&nbsp; Alas, I fear with justice!&nbsp;
For if I call Mr. Arthur Balfour a Tory will Mr. Max M&uuml;ller refute
my opinion by urging that &lsquo;a Tory meant originally an Irish rapparee,&rsquo;
or whatever the word <i>did</i> originally mean?</p>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller decides that &lsquo;we never find a religion
consisting exclusively of a belief in fetishes, or totems, or ancestral
spirits.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here, at last, we are in absolute agreement.&nbsp;
So much for totems and sign-boards.&nbsp; Only a weak fanatic will find
a totem in every animal connected with gods, sacred names, and religious
symbols.&nbsp; But totemism is a fact, whether &lsquo;totem&rsquo; originally
meant a clan-mark or sign-board in America or not.&nbsp; And, like Mr.
Sayce, Mr. Frazer, Mr. Rhys, Dr. Robertson Smith, I believe that totemism
has left marks in civilised myth, ritual, and religion, and that these
survivals, not a &lsquo;disease of language,&rsquo; explain certain
odd elements in the old civilisations.</p>
<h3>A Weak Brother</h3>
<p>Our author&rsquo;s habit of omitting references to his opponents
has here caused me infinite inconvenience.&nbsp; He speaks of some eccentric
person who has averred that a &lsquo;fetish&rsquo; is a &lsquo;totem,&rsquo;
inhabited by &lsquo;an ancestral spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp; To myself it seems
that you might as well say &lsquo;Abracadabra is gas and gaiters.&rsquo;&nbsp;
As no reference was offered, I invented &lsquo;a wild surmise&rsquo;
that Mr. Max M&uuml;ller had conceivably misapprehended Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s
theory of the origin of totems.&nbsp; Had our author only treated himself
fairly, he would have referred to his own <i>Anthropological</i> <i>Religion</i>
(pp. 126 and 407), where the name of the eccentric definer is given
as that of Herr Lippert. <a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78">{78}</a>&nbsp;
Then came into my mind the words of Professor Tiele, &lsquo;Beware of
weak brethren&rsquo;&mdash;such as Herr Lippert seems, as far as this
definition is concerned, to be.</p>
<p>Nobody knows the origin of totemism.&nbsp; We find no race on its
way to becoming totemistic, though we find several in the way of ceasing
to be so.&nbsp; They are abandoning female kinship for paternity; their
rules of marriage and taboo are breaking down; perhaps various totem
kindreds of different crests and names are blending into one local tribe,
under the name, perhaps, of the most prosperous totem-kin.&nbsp; But
we see no race on its way to becoming totemistic, so we have no historical
evidence as to the origin of the institution.&nbsp; Mr. McLennan offered
no conjecture, Professor Robertson Smith offered none, nor have I displayed
the spirit of scientific exactitude by a guess in the dark.&nbsp; To
gratify Mr. Max M&uuml;ller by defining totemism as Mr. McLennan first
used the term is all that I dare do.&nbsp; Here one may remark that
if Mr. Max M&uuml;ller really wants &lsquo;an accurate definition&rsquo;
of totemism, the works of McLennan, Frazer, Robertson Smith, and myself
are accessible, and contain our definitions.&nbsp; He does not produce
these definitions, and criticise them; he produces Dr. Lippert&rsquo;s
and criticises that.&nbsp; An argument should be met in its strongest
and most authoritative form.&nbsp; &lsquo;Define what you mean by a
totem,&rsquo; says Professor Max M&uuml;ller in his <i>Gifford</i> <i>Lectures</i>
of 1891 (p. 123).&nbsp; He had to look no further for a definition,
an authoritative definition, than to &lsquo;totem&rsquo; in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>
<i>Britannica</i>, or to McLennan.&nbsp; Yet his large and intelligent
Glasgow audience, and his readers, may very well be under the impression
that a definition of &lsquo;totem&rsquo; is &lsquo;still to seek,&rsquo;
like Prince Charlie&rsquo;s religion.&nbsp; Controversy simply cannot
be profitably conducted on these terms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The best representatives of anthropology are now engaged not
so much in comparing as in discriminating.&rsquo; <a name="citation79"></a><a href="#footnote79">{79}</a>&nbsp;
Why not refer, then, to the results of their discriminating efforts?&nbsp;
&lsquo;To treat all animal worship as due to totemism is a mistake.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Do we make it?</p>
<h3>Mr. Frazer and Myself</h3>
<p>There is, or was, a difference of opinion between Mr. Frazer and
myself as to the causes of the appearance of certain sacred animals
in Greek religion.&nbsp; My notions were published in <i>Myth</i>, <i>Ritual</i>,
<i>and</i> <i>Religion</i> (1887), Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s in <i>The</i>
<i>Golden</i> <i>Bough</i> (1890).&nbsp; Necessarily I was unaware in
1887 of Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s still unpublished theory.&nbsp; Now that
I have read it, he seems to me to have the better logic on his side;
and if I do not as yet wholly agree with him, it is because I am not
yet certain that both of our theories may not have their proper place
in Greek mythology.</p>
<h3>Greek Totemism</h3>
<p>In <i>C</i>. <i>and</i> <i>M</i>. (p. 106) I describe the social
aspects of totemism.&nbsp; I ask if there are traces of it in Greece.&nbsp;
Suppose, for argument&rsquo;s sake, that in prehistoric Greece the mouse
had been a totem, as it is among the Oraons of Bengal. <a name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80">{80}</a>&nbsp;
In that case (1) places might be named from a mouse tribe; (2) mice
might be held sacred <i>per</i> <i>se</i>; (3) the mouse name might
be given locally to a god who superseded the mouse in pride of place;
(4) images of the mouse might be associated with that of the god, (5)
and used as a local badge or mark; (6) myths might be invented to explain
the forgotten cause of this prominence of the mouse.&nbsp; If all these
notes occur, they would raise a presumption in favour of totemism in
the past of Greece.&nbsp; I then give evidence in detail, proving that
all these six facts do occur among Greeks of the Troads and sporadically
elsewhere.&nbsp; I add that, granting for the sake of argument that
these traces may point to totemism in the remote past, the mouse, though
originally a totem, &lsquo;<i>need</i> <i>not</i> <i>have</i> <i>been</i>
<i>an</i> <i>Aryan</i> <i>totem</i>&rsquo; (p. 116).</p>
<p>I offer a list of other animals closely connected with Apollo, giving
him a beast&rsquo;s name (wolf, ram, dolphin), and associated with him
in myth and art.&nbsp; In <i>M</i>. <i>R</i>. <i>R</i>. I apply similar
arguments in the case of Artemis and the Bear, of Dionysus and the Bull,
Demeter and the Pig, and so forth.&nbsp; Moreover, I account for the
myths of descent of Greek human families from gods disguised as dogs,
ants, serpents, bulls, and swans, on the hypothesis that kindreds who
originally, in totemistic fashion, traced to beasts <i>sans</i> <i>phrase</i>,
later explained their own myth to themselves by saying that the paternal
beast was only a god in disguise and <i>en</i> <i>bonne</i> <i>fortune</i>.</p>
<p>This hypothesis at least &lsquo;colligates the facts,&rsquo; and
brings them into intelligible relationship with widely-diffused savage
institutions and myths.</p>
<h3>The Greek Mouse-totem?</h3>
<p>My theory connecting Apollo Smintheus and the place-names derived
from mice with a possible prehistoric mouse-totem gave me, I confess,
considerable satisfaction.&nbsp; But in Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s <i>Golden</i>
<i>Bough</i> (ii. 129-132) is published a group of cases in which mice
and other vermin are worshipped for prudential reasons&mdash;to get
them to go away.&nbsp; In the <i>Classical</i> <i>Review</i> (vol. vi.
1892) Mr. Ward Fowler quotes Aristotle and &AElig;lian on plagues of
mice, like the recent invasion of voles on the Border sheep-farms.&nbsp;
He adopts the theory that the sacred mice were adored by way of propitiating
them.&nbsp; Thus Apollo may be connected with mice, not as a god who
superseded a mouse-totem, but as an expeller of mice, like the worm-killing
Heracles, and the Locust-Heracles, and the Locust-Apollo. <a name="citation81a"></a><a href="#footnote81a">{81a}</a>&nbsp;
The locust is still painted red, salaamed to, and set free in India,
by way of propitiating his companions. <a name="citation81b"></a><a href="#footnote81b">{81b}</a>&nbsp;
Thus the Mouse-Apollo (Smintheus) would be merely a god noted for his
usefulness in getting rid of mice, and any worship given to mice (feeding
them, placing their images on altars, their stamp on coins, naming places
after them, and so on) would be mere acts of propitiation.</p>
<p>There would be no mouse-totem in the background.&nbsp; I do not feel
quite convinced&mdash;the mouse being a totem, and a sacred or tabooed
animal, in India and Egypt. <a name="citation82a"></a><a href="#footnote82a">{82a}</a>&nbsp;
But I am content to remain in a balance of opinion.&nbsp; That the Mouse
is the Night (Gubernatis), or the Lightning (Grohmann), I am disinclined
to believe.&nbsp; Philologists are very apt to jump at contending meteorological
explanations of mice and such small deer without real necessity, and
an anthropologist is very apt to jump at an equally unnecessary and
perhaps equally undemonstrated totem.</p>
<h3>Philological Theory</h3>
<p>Philological mythologists prefer to believe that the forgotten meaning
of words produced the results; that the wolf-born Apollo (&Lambda;&upsilon;&kappa;&eta;y&epsilon;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf;)
originally meant &lsquo;Light-born Apollo,&rsquo; <a name="citation82b"></a><a href="#footnote82b">{82b}</a>
and that the wolf came in from a confusion between &lambda;&upsilon;&kappa;&eta;,
&lsquo;Light,&rsquo; and &lambda;&upsilon;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
a wolf.&nbsp; I make no doubt that philologists can explain Sminthian
Apollo, the Dog-Apollo, and all the rest in the same way, and account
for all the other peculiarities of place-names, myths, works of art,
local badges, and so forth.&nbsp; We must then, I suppose, infer that
these six traits of the mouse, already enumerated, tally with the traces
which actual totemism would or might leave surviving behind it, or which
propitiation of mice might leave behind it, by a chance coincidence,
determined by forgotten meanings of words.&nbsp; The Greek analogy to
totemistic facts would be explained, (1) either by asking for a definition
of totemism, and not listening when it is given; or (2) by maintaining
that savage totemism is also a result of a world-wide malady of language,
which, in a hundred tongues, produced the same confusions of thought,
and consequently the same practices and institutions.&nbsp; Nor do I
for one moment doubt that the ingenuity of philologists could prove
the name of every beast and plant, in every language under heaven, to
be a name for the &lsquo;inevitable dawn&rsquo; (Max M&uuml;ller), or
for the inevitable thunder, or storm, or lightning (Kuhn-Schwartz).&nbsp;
But as names appear to yield storm, lightning, night, or dawn with equal
ease and certainty, according as the scholar prefers dawn or storm,
I confess that this demonstration would leave me sceptical.&nbsp; It
lacks scientific exactitude.</p>
<h3>Mr. Frazer on&nbsp; Animals in Greek Religion</h3>
<p>In <i>The</i> <i>Golden</i> <i>Bough</i> (ii. 37) Mr. Frazer, whose
superior knowledge and acuteness I am pleased to confess, has a theory
different from that which I (following McLennan) propounded before <i>The</i>
<i>Golden</i> <i>Bough</i> appeared.&nbsp; Greece had a bull-shaped
Dionysus. <a name="citation83a"></a><a href="#footnote83a">{83a}</a>&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is left no room to doubt that in rending and devouring
a live bull at his festival, his worshippers believed that they were
killing the god, eating his flesh, and drinking his blood.&rsquo; <a name="citation83b"></a><a href="#footnote83b">{83b}</a>&nbsp;
Mr. Frazer concludes that there are two possible explanations of Dionysus
in his bull aspect. (1)&nbsp; This was an expression of his character
as a deity of vegetation, &lsquo;especially as the bull is a common
embodiment of the corn-spirit in Northern Europe.&rsquo; <a name="citation84a"></a><a href="#footnote84a">{84a}</a>&nbsp;
(2)&nbsp; The other possible explanation &lsquo;appears to be the view
taken by Mr. Lang, who suggests that the bull-formed Dionysus &ldquo;had
either been developed out of, or had succeeded to, the worship of a
bull-totem.&rdquo;&rsquo; <a name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b">{84b}</a></p>
<p>Now, anthropologists are generally agreed, I think, that occasional
sacrifices of and communion in the flesh of the totem or other sacred
animals do occur among totemists. <a name="citation84c"></a><a href="#footnote84c">{84c}</a>&nbsp;
But Mr. Frazer and I both admit, and indeed are eager to state publicly,
that the evidence for sacrifice of the totem, and communion in eating
him, is very scanty.&nbsp; The fact is rather inferred from rites among
peoples just emerging from totemism (see the case of the Californian
buzzard, in Bancroft) than derived from actual observation.&nbsp; On
this head too much has been taken for granted by anthropologists.&nbsp;
But I learn that direct evidence has been obtained, and is on the point
of publication.&nbsp; The facts I may not anticipate here, but the evidence
will be properly sifted, and bias of theory discounted.</p>
<p>To return to my theory of the development of Dionysus into a totem,
or of his inheritance of the rites of a totem, Mr. Frazer says, &lsquo;Of
course this is possible, but it is not yet certain that Aryans ever
had totemism.&rsquo; <a name="citation84d"></a><a href="#footnote84d">{84d}</a>&nbsp;
Now, in writing of the mouse, I had taken care to observe that, in origin,
the mouse as a totem need not have been Aryan, but adopted.&nbsp; People
who think that the Aryans did not pass through a stage of totemism,
female kin, and so forth, can always fall back (to account for apparent
survivals of such things among Aryans) on &lsquo;Pre-Aryan conquered
peoples,&rsquo; such as the Picts.&nbsp; Aryans may be enticed by these
bad races and become <i>Pictis</i> <i>ipsis</i> <i>Pictiores</i>.</p>
<h3>Aryan Totems (?)</h3>
<p>Generally speaking (and how delightfully characteristic of us all
is this!), I see totems in Greek sacred beasts, where Mr. Frazer sees
the corn-spirit embodied in a beast, and where Mr. Max M&uuml;ller sees
(in the case of Indra, called the bull) &lsquo;words meaning simply
male, manly, strong,&rsquo; an &lsquo;animal simile.&rsquo; <a name="citation85a"></a><a href="#footnote85a">{85a}</a>&nbsp;
Here, of course, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller is wholly in the right, when a
Vedic poet calls Indra &lsquo;strong bull,&rsquo; or the like.&nbsp;
Such poetic epithets do not afford the shadow of a presumption for Vedic
totemism, even as a survival.&nbsp; Mr. Frazer agrees with me and Mr.
Max M&uuml;ller in this certainty.&nbsp; I myself say, &lsquo;If in
the shape of Indra there be traces of fur and feather, they are not
very numerous nor very distinct, but we give them for what they may
be worth.&rsquo;&nbsp; I then give them. <a name="citation85b"></a><a href="#footnote85b">{85b}</a>&nbsp;
To prove that I do not force the evidence, I take the Vedic text. <a name="citation85c"></a><a href="#footnote85c">{85c}</a>&nbsp;
&lsquo;His mother, a cow, bore Indra, an unlicked calf.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I then give Sayana&rsquo;s explanation.&nbsp; Indra entered into the
body of Dakshina, and was reborn of her.&nbsp; She also bore a cow.&nbsp;
But this legend, I say, &lsquo;has rather the air of being an invention,
<i>apr&egrave;s</i> <i>coup</i>, to account for the Vedic text of calf
Indra, born from a cow, than of being a genuine ancient myth.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Vedic myth of Indra&rsquo;s amours in shape of a ram, I say &lsquo;will
doubtless be explained away as metaphorical.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nay, I will
go further.&nbsp; It is perfectly conceivable to me that in certain
cases a poetic epithet applied by a poet to a god (say bull, ram, or
snake) <i>might</i> be misconceived, and <i>might</i> give rise to the
worship of a god as a bull, or snake, or ram.&nbsp; Further, if civilised
ideas perished, and if a race retained a bull-god, born of their degradation
and confusion of mind, they might eat him in a ritual sacrifice.&nbsp;
But that <i>all</i> totemistic races are totemistic, because they all
first metaphorically applied animal names to gods, and then forgot what
they had meant, and worshipped these animals, <i>sans</i> <i>phrase</i>,
appears to me to be, if not incredible, still greatly in want of evidence.</p>
<h3>Mr. Frazer and I</h3>
<p>It is plain that where a people claim no connection by descent and
blood from a sacred animal, are neither of his name nor kin, the essential
feature of totemism is absent.&nbsp; I do not see that eaters of the
bull Dionysus or cultivators of the pig Demeter <a name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86">{86}</a>
made any claim to kindred with either god.&nbsp; Their towns were not
allied in name with pig or bull.&nbsp; If traces of such a belief existed,
they have been sloughed off.&nbsp; Thus Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s explanation
of Greek pigs and bulls and all their odd rites, as connected with the
beast in which the corn-spirit is incarnate, holds its ground better
than my totemistic suggestion.&nbsp; But I am not sure that the corn-spirit
accounts for the Sminthian mouse in all his aspects, nor for the Arcadian
and Attic bear-rites and myths of Artemis.&nbsp; Mouse and bear do appear
in Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s catalogue of forms of the corn-spirits, taken
from Mannhardt. <a name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87">{87}</a>&nbsp;
But the Arcadians, as we shall see, <i>claimed</i> <i>descent</i> from
a bear, and the mouse place-names and badges of the Troad yield a hint
of the same idea.&nbsp; The many Greek family claims to descent from
gods as dogs, bulls, ants, serpents, and so on, <i>may</i> spring from
gratitude to the corn-spirit.&nbsp; Does Mr. Frazer think so?&nbsp;
Nobody knows so well as he that similar claims of descent from dogs
and snakes are made by many savage kindreds who have no agriculture,
no corn, and, of course, no corn-spirits.&nbsp; These remarks, I trust,
are not undiscriminating, and naturally I yield the bull Dionysus and
the pig Demeter to the corn-spirit, <i>vice</i> totem, superseded.&nbsp;
But I do hanker after the Arcadian bear as, at least, a possible survival
of totemism.&nbsp; The Scottish school inspector removed a picture of
Behemoth, as a fabulous animal, from the wall of a school room.&nbsp;
But, not being sure of the natural history of the unicorn, &lsquo;he
just let him bide, and gave the puir beast the benefit o&rsquo; the
doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Will Mr. Frazer give the Arcadian bear &lsquo;the benefit of the
doubt&rsquo;?</p>
<p>I am not at all bigoted in the opinion that the Greeks may have once
been totemists.&nbsp; The strongest presumption in favour of the hypothesis
is the many claims of descent from a god disguised as a beast.&nbsp;
But the institution, if ever it did exist among the ancestors of the
Greeks, had died out very long before Homer.&nbsp; We cannot expect
to find traces of the prohibition to marry a woman of the same totem.&nbsp;
In Rome we do find traces of exogamy, as among totemists.&nbsp; &lsquo;Formerly
they did not marry women connected with them by blood.&rsquo; <a name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a">{88a}</a>&nbsp;
But we do not find, and would not expect to find, that the &lsquo;blood&rsquo;
was indicated by the common totem.</p>
<h3>Mr. Frazer on Origin of Totemism</h3>
<p>Mr. Frazer has introduced the term &lsquo;sex-totems,&rsquo; in application
to Australia.&nbsp; This is connected with his theory of the Origin
of Totemism.&nbsp; I cannot quite approve of the term sex-totems.</p>
<p>If in Australia each sex has a protecting animal&mdash;the men a
bat, the women an owl&mdash;if the slaying of a bat by a woman menaces
the death of a man, if the slaying of an owl by a woman may cause the
decease of a man, all that is very unlike totemism in other countries.&nbsp;
Therefore, I ask Mr. Frazer whether, in the interests of definite terminology,
he had not better give some other name than &lsquo;totem&rsquo; to his
Australian sex protecting animals?&nbsp; He might take for a <i>local</i>
fact, a <i>local</i> name, and say &lsquo;Sex-kobong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Once more, for even we anthropologists have our bickerings, I would
&lsquo;hesitate dislike&rsquo; of this passage in Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s
work: <a name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b">{88b}</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;When a savage <i>names</i> <i>himself</i> after an animal,
calls it his brother, and refuses to kill it, the animal is said to
be his totem.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>Distinguo</i>!&nbsp; A savage does not
name <i>himself</i> after his totem, any more than Mr. Frazer named
himself by his clan-name, originally Norman.&nbsp; It was not as when
Miss Betty Amory named herself &lsquo;Blanche,&rsquo; by her own will
and fantasy.&nbsp; A savage <i>inherits</i> his totem name, usually
through the mother&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; The special animal which protects
an individual savage (Zapotec, <i>tona</i>; Guatemalan, <i>nagual</i>;
North America, <i>Manitou</i>, &lsquo;medicine&rsquo;) is <i>not</i>
that savage&rsquo;s totem. <a name="citation89a"></a><a href="#footnote89a">{89a}</a>&nbsp;
The <i>nagual</i>, <i>tona</i>, or <i>manitou</i> is selected for each
particular savage, at birth or puberty, in various ways: in America,
North and Central, by a dream in a fast, or after a dream.&nbsp; (&lsquo;Post-hypnotic
suggestion.&rsquo;)&nbsp; But a savage is born to his kin-totem.&nbsp;
A man is born a wolf of the Delawares, his totem is the wolf, he cannot
help himself.&nbsp; But after, or in, his medicine fast and sleep, he
may choose a dormouse or a squirrel for his manitou (<i>tona</i>, <i>nagual</i>)
or <i>private</i> protecting animal.&nbsp; These are quite separate
from totems, as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller also points out.</p>
<p>Of totems, I, for one, must always write in the sense of Mr. McLennan,
who introduced totemism to science.&nbsp; Thus, to speak of &lsquo;sex-totems,&rsquo;
or to call the protecting animal of each individual a &lsquo;totem,&rsquo;
is, I fear, to bring in confusion, and to justify Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
hard opinion that &lsquo;totemism&rsquo; is ill-defined.&nbsp; For myself,
I use the term in the strict sense which I have given, and in no other.</p>
<p>Mr. McLennan did not profess, as we saw, to know the origin of totems.&nbsp;
He once made a guess in conversation with me, but he abandoned it.&nbsp;
Professor Robertson Smith did not know the origin of totems.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
origin of totems is as much a problem as the origin of local gods.&rsquo;
<a name="citation89b"></a><a href="#footnote89b">{89b}</a>&nbsp; Mr.
Max M&uuml;ller knows the origin: sign-boards are the origin, or one
origin.&nbsp; But what was the origin of sign-boards?&nbsp; &lsquo;We
carry the pictures of saints on our banners because we worship them;
we don&rsquo;t worship them because we carry them as banners,&rsquo;
says De Brosses, an acute man.&nbsp; Did the Indians worship totems
because they carved them on sign-boards (if they all did so), or did
they carve them on sign-boards because they worshipped them?</p>
<h3>Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s Theory</h3>
<p>The Australian respects his &lsquo;sex-totem&rsquo; because the life
of his sex is bound up in its life.&nbsp; He speaks of it as his brother,
and calls himself (as distinguished by his sex) by its name.&nbsp; As
a man he is a bat, as a woman his wife is an owl.&nbsp; As a member
of a given human kin he may be a kangaroo, perhaps his wife may be an
emu.&nbsp; But Mr. Frazer derives totemism, all the world over, from
the same origin as he assigns to &lsquo;sex-totems.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
these the life of each sex is bound up, therefore they are by each sex
revered.&nbsp; Therefore totemism must have the same origin, substituting
&lsquo;kin&rsquo; or &lsquo;tribe&rsquo; for sex.&nbsp; He gives examples
from Australia, in which killing a man&rsquo;s totem killed the man.
<a name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90">{90}</a></p>
<p>I would respectfully demur or suggest delay.&nbsp; Can we explain
an American institution, a fairly world-wide institution, totemism,
by the local peculiarities of belief in isolated Australia?&nbsp; If,
in America, to kill a wolf was to kill Uncas or Chingachgook, I would
incline to agree with Mr. Frazer.&nbsp; But no such evidence is adduced.&nbsp;
Nor does it help Mr. Frazer to plead that the killing of an American&rsquo;s
<i>nagual</i> or of a Zulu&rsquo;s <i>Ihlozi</i> kills that Zulu or
American.&nbsp; For a <i>nagual</i>, as I have shown, is one thing and
a totem is another; nor am I aware that Zulus are totemists.&nbsp; The
argument of Mr. Frazer is based on analogy and on a special instance.&nbsp;
That instance of the Australians is so archaic that it <i>may</i> show
totemism in an early form.&nbsp; Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s may be a correct
hypothesis, but it needs corroboration.&nbsp; However, Mr. Frazer concludes:
&lsquo;The totem, if I am right, is simply the receptacle in which a
man keeps his life.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet he never shows that a Choctaw <i>does</i>
keep his life in his totem.&nbsp; Perhaps the Choctaw is afraid to let
out so vital a secret.&nbsp; The less reticent Australian blurts it
forth.&nbsp; Suppose the hypothesis correct.&nbsp; Men and women keep
their lives in their <i>naguals</i>, private sacred beasts.&nbsp; But
why, on this score, should a man be afraid to make love to a woman of
the same <i>nagual</i>?&nbsp; Have Red Indian <i>women</i> any <i>naguals</i>?&nbsp;
I never heard of them.</p>
<p>Since writing this I have read Miss Kingsley&rsquo;s <i>Travels</i>
<i>in</i> <i>West</i> <i>Africa</i>.&nbsp; There the &lsquo;bush-souls&rsquo;
which she mentions (p. 459) bear analogies to totems, being inherited
sacred animals, connected with the life of members of families.&nbsp;
The evidence, though vaguely stated, favours Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s hypothesis,
to which Miss Kingsley makes no allusion.</p>
<h2>THE VALIDITY OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL EVIDENCE</h2>
<h3>Anthropological Evidence</h3>
<p>In all that we say of totemism, as, later, of fetishism, we rely
on an enormous mass of evidence from geographers, historians, travellers,
settlers, missionaries, explorers, traders, Civil Servants, and European
officers of native police in Australia and Burmah.&nbsp; Our witnesses
are of all ages, from Herodotus to our day, of many nations, of many
creeds, of different theoretical opinions.&nbsp; This evidence, so world-wide,
so diversified in source, so old, and so new, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller impugns.&nbsp;
But, before meeting his case, let us clear up a personal question.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Positions one never held&rsquo;</h3>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It is not pleasant [writes our author] to have
to defend positions which one never held, nor wishes to hold, and I
am therefore all the more grateful to those who have pointed out the
audacious misrepresentations of my real opinion in comparative mythology,
and have rebuked the flippant tone of some of my eager critics&rsquo;
[i. 26, 27].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I must here confess to the belief that no gentleman or honest man
ever <i>consciously</i> misrepresents the ideas of an opponent.&nbsp;
If it is not too flippant an illustration, I would say that no bowler
ever throws consciously and wilfully; his action, however, may unconsciously
develop into a throw.&nbsp; There would be no pleasure in argument,
cricket, or any other sport if we knowingly cheated.&nbsp; Thus it is
always <i>unconsciously</i> that adversaries pervert, garble, and misrepresent
each other&rsquo;s opinions; unconsciously, not &lsquo;audaciously.&rsquo;&nbsp;
If people would start from the major premise that misrepresentations,
if such exist, are unconscious errors, much trouble would be spared.</p>
<h3>Positions which I never held</h3>
<p>Thus Mr. Max M&uuml;ller never dreamed of &lsquo;audaciously misrepresenting&rsquo;
me when, in four lines, he made two statements about my opinions and
my materials which are at the opposite pole from the accurate (i. 12):
&lsquo;When I speak of the Vedic <i>Rishis</i> as primitive, I do not
mean what Mr. A. Lang means when he calls his savages primitive.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But I have stated again and again that I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> call my
savages &lsquo;primitive.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus &lsquo;contemporary savages
may be degraded, they certainly are not primitive.&rsquo; <a name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a">{93a}</a>&nbsp;
&lsquo;One thing about the past of [contemporary] savages we do know:
it must have been a long past.&rsquo; <a name="citation93b"></a><a href="#footnote93b">{93b}</a>&nbsp;
&lsquo;We do not wish to call savages primitive.&rsquo; <a name="citation93c"></a><a href="#footnote93c">{93c}</a>&nbsp;
All this was written in reply to the very proper caution of Dr. Fairbairn
that &lsquo;savages are not primitive.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course they are
not; that is of the essence of my theory.&nbsp; I regret the use of
the word &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; even in <i>Primitive</i> <i>Culture</i>.&nbsp;
Savages, as a rule, are <i>earlier</i>, more backward than civilised
races, as, of course, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller admits, where language is
concerned. <a name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94">{94}</a>&nbsp;
Now, after devoting several pages to showing in detail how very far
from primitive even the Australian tribes are, might I (if I were ill-natured)
not say that Mr. Max M&uuml;ller &lsquo;audaciously misrepresents&rsquo;
me when he avers that I &lsquo;call my savages primitive&rsquo;?&nbsp;
But he never dreamed of misrepresenting me; he only happened not to
understand my position.&nbsp; However, as he complains in his own case,
&lsquo;it is not pleasant to have to defend positions which one never
held&rsquo; (i. 26), and, indeed, I shall defend no such position.</p>
<p>My adversary next says that my &lsquo;savages are of the nineteenth
century.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is of the essence of my theory that my savages
are of many different centuries.&nbsp; Those described by Herodotus,
Strabo, Dio Cassius, Christoval de Moluna, Sahagun, Cieza de Leon, Br&eacute;beuf,
Garoilasso de la Vega, Lafitau, Nicholas Damascenus, Leo Africanus,
and a hundred others, are <i>not</i> of the nineteenth century.&nbsp;
This fact is essential, because the evidence of old writers, from Herodotus
to Egede, corroborates the evidence of travellers, Indian Civil Servants,
and missionaries of today, by what Dr. Tylor, when defending our materials,
calls &lsquo;the test of recurrence.&rsquo;&nbsp; Professor Millar used
the same argument in his <i>Origin</i> <i>of</i> <i>Rank</i>, in the
last century.&nbsp; Thus Mr. Max M&uuml;ller unconsciously misrepresents
me (and my savages) when he says that my &lsquo;savages are of the nineteenth
century.&rsquo;&nbsp; The fact is the reverse.&nbsp; They are of many
centuries.&nbsp; These two unconscious misrepresentations occur in four
consecutive lines.</p>
<h3>Anthropological Evidence</h3>
<p>In connection with this topic (the nature of anthropological evidence),
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller (i. 205-207) repeats what he has often said before.&nbsp;
Thus he cites Dr. Codrington&rsquo;s remarks, most valuable remarks,
on the difficulty of reporting correctly about the ideas and ways of
savages.&nbsp; I had cited the same judicious writer to the same effect,
<a name="citation95"></a><a href="#footnote95">{95}</a> and had compiled
a number of instances in which the errors of travellers were exposed,
and their habitual fallacies were detected.&nbsp; Fifteen closely printed
pages were devoted by me to a criterion of evidence, and a reply to
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s oft-repeated objections.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;When [I said] we find Dr. Codrington taking the
same precautions in Melanesia as Mr. Sproat took among the Ahts, and
when his account of Melanesian myths reads like a close copy of Mr.
Sproat&rsquo;s account of Aht legends, and when both are corroborated
[as to the existence of analogous savage myths] by the collections of
Bleek, and Hahn, and Gill, and Castren, and Rink, in far different corners
of the world; while the modern testimony of these scholarly men is in
harmony with that of the old Jesuit missionaries, and of untaught adventurers
who have lived for many years with savages, surely it will be admitted
that the difficulty of ascertaining savage opinion has been, to a great
extent, overcome.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also cited at length Dr. Tylor&rsquo;s masterly argument to the
same effect, an argument offered by him to &lsquo;a great historian,&rsquo;
apparently.</p>
<h3>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s Method of Controversy</h3>
<p>Now no member of the reading public, perusing Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
on anthropological evidence (i. 24-26, 205-207), could guess that his
cautions about evidence are not absolutely new to us.&nbsp; He could
not guess that Dr. Tylor replied to them &lsquo;before they were made&rsquo;
by our present critic (I think), and that I did the same with great
elaboration.&nbsp; Our defence of our evidence is not noticed by Mr.
Max M&uuml;ller.&nbsp; He merely repeats what he has often said before
on the subject, exactly as if anthropologists were ignorant of it, and
had not carefully studied, assimilated, profited by it, and answered
it.&nbsp; Our critic and monitor might have said, &lsquo;I have examined
your test of <i>recurrences</i>, and what else you have to urge, and,
for such and such reasons, I must reject it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then we could
reconsider our position in this new light.&nbsp; But Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
does not oblige us in this way.</p>
<h3>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller on our Evidence</h3>
<p>In an earlier work, <i>The</i> <i>Gifford</i> <i>Lectures</i> for
1891, <a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96">{96}</a> our author
had devoted more space to a criticism of our evidence.&nbsp; To this,
then, we turn (pp. 169-180, 413-436).&nbsp; Passing Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
own difficulties in understanding a Mohawk (which the Mohawk no doubt
also felt in understanding Mr. Max M&uuml;ller), we reach (p. 172) the
fables about godless savages.&nbsp; These, it is admitted, are exploded
among scholars in anthropology.&nbsp; So we do, at least, examine evidence.&nbsp;
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller now fixes on a flagrant case, some fables about
the godless Mincopies of the Andaman Islands.&nbsp; But <i>he</i> relies
on the evidence of Mr. Man.&nbsp; So do I, as far as it seems beyond
doubt. <a name="citation97a"></a><a href="#footnote97a">{97a}</a>&nbsp;
Mr. Man is &lsquo;a careful observer, a student of language, and perfectly
trustworthy.&rsquo;&nbsp; These are the reasons for which I trust him.&nbsp;
But when Mr. Man says that the Mincopies have a god, Puluga, who inhabits
&lsquo;a stone house in the sky,&rsquo; I remark, &lsquo;Here the idea
of the stone house is necessarily borrowed from our stone houses at
Port Blair.&rsquo; <a name="citation97b"></a><a href="#footnote97b">{97b}</a>&nbsp;
When Mr. Man talks of Puluga&rsquo;s only-begotten son, &lsquo;a sort
of archangel,&rsquo; medium between Puluga and the angels, I &lsquo;hesitate
a doubt.&rsquo;&nbsp; Did not this idea reach the Mincopie mind from
the same quarter as the stone house, especially as Puluga&rsquo;s wife
is &lsquo;a green shrimp or an eel&rsquo;?&nbsp; At all events, it is
right to bear in mind that, as the stone house of the Mincopie heaven
is almost undeniably of European origin, the only-begotten mediating
son of Puluga and the green shrimp <i>may</i> bear traces of Christian
teaching.&nbsp; Caution is indicated.</p>
<p>Does Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, so strict about evidence, boggle at the
stone house, the only son, the shrimp?&nbsp; Not he; he never hints
at the shrimp!&nbsp; Does he point out that one anthropologist has asked
for caution in weighing what the Mincopies told Mr. Man?&nbsp; Very
far from that, he complains that &lsquo;the old story is repeated again
and again&rsquo; about the godless Andamans. <a name="citation97c"></a><a href="#footnote97c">{97c}</a>&nbsp;
The intelligent Glasgow audience could hardly guess that anthropologists
were watchful, and knew pretty well what to believe about the Mincopies.&nbsp;
Perhaps in Glasgow they do not read us anthropologists much.</p>
<p>On p. 413 our author returns to the charge.&nbsp; He observes (as
I have also observed) the often contradictory nature of our evidence.&nbsp;
Here I may offer an anecdote.&nbsp; The most celebrated of living English
philosophers heard that I was at one time writing a book on the &lsquo;ghostly&rsquo;
in history, anthropology, and society, old or new, savage or civilised.&nbsp;
He kindly dictated a letter to me asking how I could give time and pains
to any such marvels.&nbsp; For, he argued, the most unveracious fables
were occasionally told about himself in newspapers and social gossip.&nbsp;
If evidence cannot be trusted about a living and distinguished British
subject, how can it be accepted about hallucinations?</p>
<p>I replied, with respect, that on this principle nothing could be
investigated at all.&nbsp; History, justice, trade, everything would
be impossible.&nbsp; We must weigh and criticise evidence.&nbsp; As
my friendly adviser had written much on savage customs and creeds, he
best knew that conflicting testimony, even on his own chosen theme,
is not peculiar to ghost stories.&nbsp; In a world of conflicting testimony
we live by criticising it.&nbsp; Thus, when Mr. Max M&uuml;ller says
that I call my savages &lsquo;primitive,&rsquo; and when I, on the other
hand, quote passages in which I explicitly decline to do so, the evidence
as to my views is contradictory.&nbsp; Yet the truth can be discovered
by careful research.</p>
<p>The application is obvious.&nbsp; We must not despair of truth!&nbsp;
As our monitor says, &lsquo;we ought to discard all evidence that does
not come to us either from a man who was able himself to converse with
native races, or who was at least an eye-witness of what he relates.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Precisely, that is our method.&nbsp; I, for one, do not take even a
ghost story at second hand, much less anything so startling as a savage
rite.&nbsp; And we discount and allow for every bias and prejudice of
our witnesses.&nbsp; I have made a list of these <i>idola</i> in <i>M</i>.
<i>R</i>. <i>R</i>. ii. 334-344.</p>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller now gives a list of inconsistencies in descriptions
of Australian Blacks.&nbsp; They are <i>not</i> Blacks, they have a
dash of copper colour!&nbsp; Well, I never said that they had &lsquo;the
sooty tinge of the African negro.&rsquo;&nbsp; Did anybody?</p>
<p>Mr. Ridley thinks that all natives are called &lsquo;Murri.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Curr says &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&nbsp; Important.&nbsp; We must reserve
our judgment.</p>
<p>Missionaries say the Blacks are &lsquo;devoid of moral ideas.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What missionaries?&nbsp; What anthropologist believes such nonsense?&nbsp;
There are differences of opinion about landed property, communal or
private.&nbsp; The difference rages among historians of civilised races.&nbsp;
So, also, as to portable property.&nbsp; Mr. Curr (Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
witness) agrees here with those whose works I chiefly rely on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. McLennan has built a whole social theory on the statement&rsquo;
(a single statement) &lsquo;made by Sir George Grey, and contradicted
by Mr. Curr.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. McLennan would be, I think, rather surprised
at this remark; but what would he do?&nbsp; Why, he would re-examine
the whole question, decide by the balance of evidence, and reject, modify,
or retain his theory accordingly.</p>
<p>All sciences have to act in this way; therefore almost all scientific
theories are fluctuating.&nbsp; Nothing here is peculiar to anthropology.&nbsp;
A single word, or two or three, will prove or disprove a theory of phonetic
laws.&nbsp; Even phonetics are disputable ground.</p>
<p>In defence of my late friend Mr. McLennan, I must point out that
if he built a whole social theory on a single statement of Sir George
Grey&rsquo;s, and if Mr. Curr denies the truth of the statement, Mr.
Frazer has produced six or seven witnesses to the truth of that very
statement in other parts of the world than Australia. <a name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100">{100}</a>&nbsp;
To this circumstance we may return.</p>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller next produces Mr. Curr&rsquo;s opinions about
the belief in a god and morality among Australians.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here
he really contradicts himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; The disputable evidence
about Australian marriage laws is next shown to be disputable.&nbsp;
That is precisely why Dr. Tylor is applying to it his unrivalled diligence
in accurate examination.&nbsp; We await his results.&nbsp; Finally,
the contradictory evidence as to Tasmanian religion is exposed.&nbsp;
We have no Codrington or Bleek for Tasmania.&nbsp; The Tasmanians are
extinct, and Science should leave the evidence as to their religion
out of her accounts.&nbsp; We cannot cross-examine defunct Tasmanians.</p>
<p>From all this it follows that anthropologists must sift and winnow
their evidence, like men employed in every other branch of science.&nbsp;
And who denies it?&nbsp; What anthropologist of mark accepts as gospel
any casual traveller&rsquo;s tale?</p>
<h3>The Test of Recurrences</h3>
<p>Even for travellers&rsquo; tales we have a use, we can apply to them
Dr. Tylor&rsquo;s &lsquo;Test of Recurrences.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;If two independent visitors to different countries,
say a medi&aelig;val Mahommedan in Tartary and a modern Englishman in
Dahomey, or a Jesuit missionary in Brazil and a Wesley an in the Fiji
Islands, agree in describing some analogous art, or rite, or myth among
the people they have visited, it becomes difficult or impossible to
set down such correspondence to accident or wilful fraud.&nbsp; A story
by a bushranger in Australia may perhaps be objected to as a mistake
or an invention, but did a Methodist minister in Guinea conspire with
him to cheat the public by telling the same story there?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole passage should be read: it was anticipated by Professor
Millar in his <i>Origin</i> <i>of</i> <i>Rank</i>, and has been restated
by myself. <a name="citation101a"></a><a href="#footnote101a">{101a}</a>&nbsp;
Thus I wrote (in 1887) &lsquo;it is to be regretted that Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
entirely omits to mention . . . the corroboration which is derived from
the undesigned coincidence of independent testimony.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1891-1892 he still entirely omits to mention, to his Glasgow audience,
the strength of his opponents&rsquo; case.&nbsp; He would serve us better
if he would criticise the test of recurrences, and show us its weak
points.</p>
<h3>Bias of Theory</h3>
<p>Yes, our critic may reply, &lsquo;but Mr. Curr thinks that there
is a strong tendency in observers abroad, if they have become acquainted
with a new and startling theory that has become popular at home, to
see confirmations of it everywhere.&rsquo;&nbsp; So I had explicitly
stated in commenting on Dr. Tylor&rsquo;s test of recurrences. <a name="citation101b"></a><a href="#footnote101b">{101b}</a>&nbsp;
&lsquo;Travellers and missionaries have begun to read anthropological
books, and their evidence is, therefore, much more likely to be biassed
now by anthropological theories than it was of old.&rsquo;&nbsp; So
Mr. McLennan, in the very earliest of all writings on totemism, said:
&lsquo;As the totem has not till now got itself mixed up with speculations
the observers have been unbiassed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. McLennan finally
declined to admit any evidence as to the savage marriage laws collected
after his own theory, and other theories born from it, had begun to
bias observers of barbaric tribes.</p>
<p>It does not quite seem to me that Mr. Max M&uuml;ller makes his audience
acquainted with these precautions of anthropologists, with their sedulous
sifting of evidence, and watchfulness against the theoretical bias of
observers.&nbsp; Thus he assails the <i>faible</i>, not the <i>fort</i>
of our argument, and may even seem not to be aware that we have removed
the <i>faible</i> by careful discrimination.</p>
<p>What opinion must his readers, who know not Mr. McLennan&rsquo;s
works, entertain about that acute and intrepid pioneer, a man of warm
temper, I admit, a man who threw out his daringly original theory at
a heat, using at first such untrustworthy materials as lay at hand,
but a man whom disease could not daunt, and whom only death prevented
from building a stately edifice on the soil which he was the first to
explore?</p>
<p>Our author often returns to the weakness of the evidence of travellers
and missionaries.</p>
<h3>Concerning Missionaries</h3>
<p>Here is an example of a <i>vivacit&eacute;</i> in our censor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;With regard to ghosts and spirits among the Melanesians, our
authorities, whether missionaries, traders, or writers on ethnology,
are troubled by no difficulties&rsquo; (i. 207).&nbsp; Yet on this very
page Mr. Max M&uuml;ller has been citing the &lsquo;difficulties&rsquo;
which <i>do</i> &lsquo;trouble&rsquo; a &lsquo;missionary,&rsquo; Dr.
Codrington.&nbsp; And, for my own part, when I want information about
Melanesian beliefs, it is to Dr. Codrington&rsquo;s work that I go.
<a name="citation103"></a><a href="#footnote103">{103}</a>&nbsp; The
doctor, himself a missionary, <i>ex</i> <i>hypothesi</i> &lsquo;untroubled
by difficulties,&rsquo; has just been quoted by Mr. Max M&uuml;ller,
and by myself, as a witness to the difficulties which trouble himself
and us.&nbsp; What can Mr. Max M&uuml;ller possibly mean?&nbsp; Am I
wrong?&nbsp; Was Dr. Codrington <i>not</i> a missionary?&nbsp; At all
events, he is the authority on Melanesia, a &lsquo;high&rsquo; authority
(i. 206).</p>
<h2>THE PHILOLOGICAL METHOD IN ANTHROPOLOGY</h2>
<h3>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller as Ethnologist</h3>
<p>Our author is apt to remonstrate with his anthropological critics,
and to assure them that he also has made studies in ethnology.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am not such a despairer of ethnology as some ethnologists would
have me.&rsquo;&nbsp; He refers us to the assistance which he lent in
bringing out Dr. Hahn&rsquo;s <i>Tsuni</i>-<i>Goam</i> (1881), Mr. Gill&rsquo;s
<i>Myths</i> <i>and</i> <i>Songs</i> <i>from</i> <i>the</i> <i>South</i>
<i>Pacific</i> (1876), and probably other examples could be added.&nbsp;
But my objection is, not that we should be ungrateful to Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
for these and other valuable services to anthropology, but that, when
he has got his anthropological material, he treats it in what I think
the wrong way, or approves of its being so treated.</p>
<p>Here, indeed, is the irreconcilable difference between two schools
of mythological interpretation.&nbsp; Given Dr. Hahn&rsquo;s book, on
Hottentot manners and religion: the anthropologist compares the Hottentot
rites, beliefs, social habits, and general ideas with those of other
races known to him, savage or civilised.&nbsp; A Hottentot custom, which
has a meaning among Hottentots, may exist where its meaning is lost,
among Greeks or other &lsquo;Aryans.&rsquo;&nbsp; A story of a Hottentot
god, quite a natural sort of tale for a Hottentot to tell, may be told
about a god in Greece, where it is contrary to the Greek spirit.&nbsp;
We infer that the Greeks perhaps inherited it from savage ancestors,
or borrowed it from savages.</p>
<h3>Names of Savage Gods</h3>
<p>This is the method, and if we can also get a scholar to analyse the
<i>names</i> of Hottentot gods, we are all the luckier, that is, if
his processes and inferences are <i>logical</i>.&nbsp; May we not decide
on the <i>logic</i> of scholars?&nbsp; But, just as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
points out to us the dangers attending our evidence, we point out to
him the dangers attending his method.&nbsp; In Dr. Hahn&rsquo;s book,
the doctor analyses the meaning of the name Tsuni-Goam and other names,
discovers their original sense, and from that sense explains the myths
about Hottentot divine beings.</p>
<p>Here we anthropologists first ask Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, before accepting
Dr. Hahn&rsquo;s etymologies, to listen to other scholars about the
perils and difficulties of the philological analysis of divine names,
even in Aryan languages.&nbsp; I have already quoted his &lsquo;defender,&rsquo;
Dr. Tiele.&nbsp; &lsquo;The philological method is inadequate and misleading,
when it is a question of (1) discovering the origin of a myth, or (2)
the physical explanation of the oldest myths, or (3) of accounting for
the rude and obscene element in the divine legends of civilised races.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To the two former purposes Dr. Hahn applies the philological method
in the case of Tsuni-Goam.&nbsp; Other scholars agree with Dr. Tiele.&nbsp;
Mannhardt, as we said, held that Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s favourite
etymological &lsquo;equations,&rsquo; Sarameya=Hermeias; Saranyu=Demeter-Erinnys;
Kentauros=Gandharvas and others, would not stand criticism.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
method in its practical working shows a lack of the historical sense,&rsquo;
said Mannhardt.&nbsp; Curtius&mdash;a scholar, as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
declares (i. 32)&mdash;says, &lsquo;It is especially difficult to conjecture
the meaning of proper names, and above all of local and mythical names.&rsquo;
<a name="citation106a"></a><a href="#footnote106a">{106a}</a>&nbsp;
I do not see that it is easier when these names are not Greek, but Hottentot,
or Algonquin!</p>
<p>Thus Achilles may as easily mean &lsquo;holder of the people&rsquo;
as &lsquo;holder of stones,&rsquo; <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. a River-god!&nbsp;
Or does &Alpha;&chi; suggest <i>aqua</i>, Achelous the River?&nbsp;
Leto, mother of Apollo, cannot be from &lambda;&alpha;&theta;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;,
as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller holds (ii. 514, 515), to which Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
replies, perhaps not, as far as the phonetic rules go &lsquo;which determine
the formation of appellative nouns.&nbsp; It, indeed, would be extraordinary
if it were. . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; The phonetic rules in Hottentot may also
suggest difficulties to a South African Curtius!</p>
<p>Other scholars agree with Curtius&mdash;agree in thinking that the
etymology of mythical names is a sandy foundation for the science of
mythology.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The difficult task of interpreting mythical names has, so
far, produced few certain results,&rsquo; says Otto Schrader. <a name="citation106b"></a><a href="#footnote106b">{106b}</a></p>
<p>When Dr. Hahn applies the process in Hottentot, we urge with a friendly
candour these cautions from scholars on Mr. Max M&uuml;ller.</p>
<h3>A Hottentot God</h3>
<p>In <i>Custom</i> <i>and</i> <i>Myth</i> (p. 207), I examine the logic
by which Dr. Hahn proves Tsuni-Goam to be &lsquo;The Red Dawn.&rsquo;&nbsp;
One of his steps is to say that few means &lsquo;sore,&rsquo; or &lsquo;wounded,&rsquo;
and that a wound is <i>red</i>, so he gets his &lsquo;red&rsquo; in
Red Dawn.&nbsp; But of <i>tsu</i> in the sense of &lsquo;red&rsquo;
he gives not one example, while he does give another word for &lsquo;red,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;bloody.&rsquo;&nbsp; This may be scholarly but it is not evidence,
and this is only one of many perilous steps on ground extremely <i>scabreux</i>,
got over by a series of logical leaps.&nbsp; As to our quarrel with
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller about his friend&rsquo;s treatment of ethnological
materials, it is this: we do not believe in the validity of the etymological
method when applied to many old divine names in Greek, still less in
Hottentot.</p>
<h3>Cause of our Scepticism</h3>
<p>Our scepticism is confirmed by the extraordinary diversity of opinion
among scholars as to what the right analysis of old divine names is.&nbsp;
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller writes (i. 18): &lsquo;I have never been able to
extract from my critics the title of a single book in which my etymologies
and my mythological equations had been seriously criticised by real
scholars.&rsquo;&nbsp; We might answer, &lsquo;Why tell you what you
know very well?&rsquo;&nbsp; For (i. 50) you say that while Signer Canizzaro
calls some of your &lsquo;equations&rsquo; &lsquo;irrefutably demonstrated,&rsquo;
&lsquo;other scholars declare these equations are futile and impossible.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Do these other scholars criticise your equations not &lsquo;seriously&rsquo;?&nbsp;
Or are you ignorant of the names of their works?</p>
<p>Another case.&nbsp; Our author says that &lsquo;many objections were
raised&rsquo; to his &lsquo;equation&rsquo; of Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc;=Ahan&acirc;=&lsquo;Dawn&rsquo;
(ii. 378, 400, &amp;c.).&nbsp; Have the objections ceased?&nbsp; Here
are a few scholars who do not, or did not, accept Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc;=Ahan&acirc;:
Welcker, Benfey, Curtius, Preller, Furtw&auml;ngler, Schwartz, and now
Bechtel (i. 378).&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller thinks that he is right,
but, till scholars agree, what can we do but wait?</p>
<h3>Phonetic Bickerings</h3>
<p>The evidence turns on theories of phonetic laws as they worked in
pre-Homeric Greece.&nbsp; But these laws, as they apply to common ordinary
words, need <i>not</i>, we are told, be applied so strictly to proper
names, as of gods and heroes.&nbsp; These are a kind of comets, and
their changes cannot be calculated like the changes of vulgar words,
which answer to stars (i. 298).&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller &lsquo;formerly
agreed with Curtius that phonetic rules should be used against proper
names with the same severity as against ordinary nouns and verbs.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Benfey and Welcker protested, so does Professor Victor Henry.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is not fair to demand from mythography the rigorous observation
of phonetics&rsquo; (i. 387).&nbsp; &lsquo;This may be called backsliding,&rsquo;
our author confesses, and it <i>does</i> seem rather a &lsquo;go-as-you-please&rsquo;
kind of method.</p>
<h3>Phonetic Rules</h3>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller argues at length (and, to my ignorance, persuasively)
in favour of a genial laxity in the application of phonetic rules to
old proper names.&nbsp; Do they apply to these as strictly as to ordinary
words?&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a question that has often been asked . .
. but it has never been boldly answered&rsquo; (i. 297).&nbsp; Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller cannot have forgotten that Curtius answered boldly&mdash;in
the negative.&nbsp; &lsquo;Without such rigour all attempts at etymology
are impossible.&nbsp; For this very reason ethnologists and mythologists
should make themselves acquainted with the simple principles of comparative
philology.&rsquo; <a name="citation109"></a><a href="#footnote109">{109}</a></p>
<p>But it is not for us to settle such disputes of scholars.&nbsp; Meanwhile
their evidence is derived from their private interpretations of old
proper names, and they differ among themselves as to whether, in such
interpretations, they should or should not be governed strictly by phonetic
laws.&nbsp; Then what Mr. Max M&uuml;ller calls &lsquo;the usual bickerings&rsquo;
begin among scholars (i. 416).&nbsp; And Mr. Max M&uuml;ller connects
Ouranos with Vedic Varuna, while Wackernagel prefers to derive it from
&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu;, urine, and this from &omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&epsilon;&omega;=Sk.
Varshay&acirc;mi, to rain (ii. 416, 417), and so it goes on for years
with a glorious uncertainty.&nbsp; If Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s equations
are scientifically correct, the scholars who accept them not must all
be unscientific.&nbsp; Or else, this is not science at all.</p>
<h3>Basis of a Science</h3>
<p>A science in its early stages, while the validity of its working
laws in application to essential cases is still undetermined, must,
of course, expect &lsquo;bickerings.&rsquo;&nbsp; But philological mythologists
are actually trying to base one science, Mythology, on the still shifting
and sandy foundations of another science, Phonetics.&nbsp; The philologists
are quarrelling about their &lsquo;equations,&rsquo; and about the application
of their phonetic laws to mythical proper names.&nbsp; On the basis
of this shaking soil, they propose to build <i>another</i> science,
Mythology!&nbsp; Then, pleased with the scientific exactitude of their
evidence, they object to the laxity of ours.</p>
<h3>Philology in Action&mdash;Indra</h3>
<p>As an example of the philological method with a Vedic god, take Indra.&nbsp;
I do not think that science is ever likely to find out the whole origins
of any god.&nbsp; Even if his name mean &lsquo;sky,&rsquo; Dyaus, Zeus,
we must ask what mode of conceiving &lsquo;sky&rsquo; is original.&nbsp;
Was &lsquo;sky&rsquo; thought of as a person, and, if so, as a savage
or as a civilised person; as a god, <i>sans</i> <i>phrase</i>; as the
inanimate visible vault of heaven; as a totem, or how?&nbsp; Indra,
like other gods, is apt to evade our observation, in his origins.&nbsp;
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller asks, &lsquo;what should we gain if we called Indra
. . . a totem?&rsquo;&nbsp; Who does?&nbsp; If we derive his name from
the same root as &lsquo;ind-u,&rsquo; <i>raindrop</i>, then &lsquo;his
starting-point was the rain&rsquo; (i. 131).&nbsp; Roth preferred &lsquo;idh,&rsquo;
&lsquo;indh,&rsquo; <i>to</i> <i>kindle</i>; and later, his taste and
fancy led him to &lsquo;ir,&rsquo; or &lsquo;irv,&rsquo; <i>to</i> <i>have</i>
<i>power</i> <i>over</i>.&nbsp; He is variously regarded as god of &lsquo;bright
firmament,&rsquo; of air, of thunderstorm personified, and so forth.
<a name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110">{110}</a>&nbsp; His
name is not detected among other Aryan gods, and his birth may be <i>after</i>
the &lsquo;Aryan Separation&rsquo; (ii. 752).&nbsp; But surely his name,
even so, might have been carried to the Greeks?&nbsp; This, at least,
should not astonish Mr. Max M&uuml;ller.&nbsp; One had supposed that
Dyaus and Zeus were separately developed, by peoples of India and Greece,
from a common, pre-separation, Aryan root.&nbsp; One had not imagined
that the Greeks <i>borrowed</i> divine names from Sanskrit and from
India.&nbsp; But this, too, might happen! (ii. 506).&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
asks, &lsquo;Why should not a cloud or air goddess <i>of</i> <i>India</i>,
whether called Sv&acirc;r&acirc; or Urvas&icirc;, have supplied the
first germs from which &Beta;&omicron;&omega;&pi;&iota;&sigmaf; &pi;&omicron;&tau;&nu;&iota;&alpha;
&Eta;&rho;&eta; descended?&rsquo;&nbsp; Why not, indeed, if prehistoric
Greeks were in touch with India?&nbsp; I do not say they were not.&nbsp;
Why should not a Vedic or Sanskrit goddess of India supply the first
germs of a Greek goddess? (ii. p. 506).&nbsp; Why, because &lsquo;Greek
gods have never been Vedic gods, but both Greek and Vedic gods have
started from the same germs&rsquo; (ii. 429).&nbsp; Our author has answered
his own question, but he seems at intervals to suppose, contrary to
his own principles, as I understand them, that Greek <i>may</i> be &lsquo;derived
from&rsquo; Vedic divine names, or, at least, divine names in Sanskrit.&nbsp;
All this is rather confusing.</p>
<h3>Obscuring the Veda</h3>
<p>If Indra is called &lsquo;bull,&rsquo; that at first only meant &lsquo;strong&rsquo;
(ii. 209).&nbsp; Yet &lsquo;some very thoughtful scholars&rsquo; see
traces of totemism in Indra! <a name="citation111a"></a><a href="#footnote111a">{111a}</a>&nbsp;
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller thinks that this theory is &lsquo;obscuring the
Veda by this kind of light from the Dark Continent&rsquo; (America,
it seems).&nbsp; Indra is said to have been born from a cow, like the
African Heitsi Eibib. <a name="citation111b"></a><a href="#footnote111b">{111b}</a>&nbsp;
There are unholy stories about Indra and rams.&nbsp; But I for one,
as I have said already, would never deny that these <i>may</i> be part
of the pleasant unconscious poetry of the Vedic hymnists.&nbsp; Indra&rsquo;s
legend is rich in savage obscenities; they may, or may not, be survivals
from savagery.&nbsp; At all events one sees no reason why we should
not freely compare parallel savageries, and why this should &lsquo;obscure&rsquo;
the Veda.&nbsp; Comparisons are illuminating.</p>
<h2>CRITICISM OF FETISHISM</h2>
<h3>Mischief of Comparisons in Comparative Mythology</h3>
<p>Not always are comparisons illuminating, it seems.&nbsp; Our author
writes, &lsquo;It may be said&mdash;in fact, it has been said&mdash;that
there can at all events be no harm in simply placing the myths and customs
of savages side by side with the myths and customs of Hindus and Greeks.&rsquo;&nbsp;
(This, in fact, is the method of the science of institutions.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;But experience shows that this is not so&rsquo; (i. 195).&nbsp;
So we must not, should not, simply place the myths and customs of savages
side by side with those of Hindus and Greeks.&nbsp; It is taboo.</p>
<h3>Dr. Oldenberg</h3>
<p>Now Dr. Oldenberg, it seems, uses such comparisons of savage and
Aryan faiths.&nbsp; Dr. Oldenberg is (i. 209) one of several &lsquo;<i>very</i>
<i>thoughtful</i> <i>scholars</i>&rsquo; who do so, who break Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s prohibition.&nbsp; Yet (ii. 220) &lsquo;<i>no</i>
<i>true</i> <i>scholar</i> would accept any comparison&rsquo; between
savage fables and the folklore of Homer and the Vedas &lsquo;as really
authoritative <i>until</i> <i>fully</i> <i>demonstrated</i> <i>on</i>
<i>both</i> <i>sides</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, it <i>is</i> &lsquo;fully
demonstrated,&rsquo; or &lsquo;a very thoughtful scholar&rsquo; (like
Dr. Oldenberg) would not accept it.&nbsp; Or it is <i>not</i> demonstrated,
and then Dr. Oldenberg, though &lsquo;a very thoughtful,&rsquo; is not
&lsquo;a true scholar.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Comparisons, when odious</h3>
<p>Once more, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller deprecates the making of comparisons
between savage and Vedic myths (i. 210), and then (i. 220) he deprecates
the <i>acceptance</i> of these very comparisons &lsquo;as really authoritative
until fully demonstrated.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, how is the validity of the
comparisons to be &lsquo;fully demonstrated&rsquo; if we are forbidden
to make them at all, because to do so is to &lsquo;obscure&rsquo; the
Veda &lsquo;by light from the Dark Continent&rsquo;?</p>
<h3>A Question of Logic</h3>
<p>I am not writing &lsquo;quips and cranks;&rsquo; I am dealing quite
gravely with the author&rsquo;s processes of reasoning.&nbsp; &lsquo;No
true scholar&rsquo; does what &lsquo;very thoughtful scholars&rsquo;
do.&nbsp; No comparisons of savage and Vedic myths should be made, but
yet, &lsquo;when fully demonstrated,&rsquo; &lsquo;true scholars would
accept them&rsquo; (i 209, 220).&nbsp; How can comparisons be demonstrated
before they are made?&nbsp; And made they must not be!</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Scholars&rsquo;</h3>
<p>It would be useful if Mr. Max M&uuml;ller were to define &lsquo;scholar,&rsquo;
&lsquo;real scholar,&rsquo; &lsquo;true scholar,&rsquo; &lsquo;very
thoughtful scholar.&rsquo;&nbsp; The latter may err, and have erred&mdash;like
General Councils, and like Dr. Oldenberg, who finds in the Veda &lsquo;remnants
of the wildest and rawest essence of religion,&rsquo; totemism, and
the rest (i. 210).&nbsp; I was wont to think that &lsquo;scholar,&rsquo;
as used by our learned author, meant &lsquo;philological mythologist,&rsquo;
as distinguished from &lsquo;not-scholar,&rsquo; that is, &lsquo;anthropological
mythologist.&rsquo;&nbsp; But now &lsquo;very thoughtful scholars,&rsquo;
even Dr. Oldenberg, Mr. Rhys, Dr. Robertson Smith, and so on, use the
anthropological method, so &lsquo;scholar&rsquo; needs a fresh definition.&nbsp;
The &lsquo;not-scholars,&rsquo; the anthropologists, have, in fact,
converted some very thoughtful scholars.&nbsp; If we could only catch
the <i>true</i> scholar!&nbsp; But that we cannot do till we fully demonstrate
comparisons which we may not make, for fear of first &lsquo;obscuring
the Veda by this kind of light from the Dark Continent.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Anthropology and the Mysteries</h3>
<p>It is not my affair to defend Dr. Oldenberg, whose comparisons of
Vedic with savage rites I have never read, I am sorry to say.&nbsp;
One is only arguing that the <i>method</i> of making such comparisons
is legitimate.&nbsp; Thus (i. 232) controversy, it seems, still rages
among scholars as to &lsquo;the object of the Eleusinian Mysteries.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Does not the scholar&rsquo;s conscience warn us against accepting
whatever in the myths and customs of the Zulus seems to suit our purpose&rsquo;&mdash;of
explaining features in the Eleusinia?&nbsp; If Zulu customs, and they
alone, contained Eleusinian parallels, even the anthropologist&rsquo;s
conscience would whisper caution.&nbsp; But this is not the case.&nbsp;
North American, Australian, African, and other tribes have mysteries
very closely and minutely resembling parts of the rites of the Eleusinia,
Dionysia, and Thesmophoria.&nbsp; Thus Lobeck, a scholar, describes
the <i>Rhombos</i> used in the Dionysiac mysteries, citing Clemens Alexandrinus.
<a name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114">{114}</a>&nbsp; Thanks
to Dr. Tylor&rsquo;s researches I was able to show (what Lobeck knew
not) that the <i>Rhombos</i> (Australian <i>turndun</i>, &lsquo;Bull-roarer&rsquo;)
is also used in Australian, African, American, and other savage religious
mysteries.&nbsp; Now should I have refrained from producing this well-attested
matter of fact till I knew Australian, American, and African languages
as well as I know Greek?&nbsp; &lsquo;What century will it be when there
will be scholars who know the dialects of the Australian blacks as well
as we know the dialects of Greece?&rsquo; (i. 232) asks our author.&nbsp;
And what in the name of Eleusis have dialects to do with the circumstance
that savages, like Greeks, use <i>Rhombi</i> in their mysteries?&nbsp;
There are abundant other material facts, visible palpable objects and
practices, which savage mysteries have in common with the Greek mysteries.
<a name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115">{115}</a>&nbsp; If
observed by deaf men, when used by dumb men, instead of by scores of
Europeans who could talk the native languages, these illuminating rites
of savages would still be evidence.&nbsp; They have been seen and described
often, not by &lsquo;a casual native informant&rsquo; (who, perhaps,
casually invented Greek rites, and falsely attributed them to his tribesmen),
but by educated Europeans.</p>
<h3>Abstract Ideas of Savages</h3>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller defends, with perfect justice, the existence
of abstract ideas among contemporary savages.&nbsp; It appears that
somebody or other has said&mdash;&lsquo;we have been told&rsquo; (i.
291)&mdash;&lsquo;that all this&rsquo; (the Mangaian theory of the universe)
&lsquo;must have come from missionaries.&rsquo;&nbsp; The ideas are
as likely to have come from Hegel as from a missionary!&nbsp; Therefore,
&lsquo;instead of looking for idols, or for totems and fetishes, we
must learn and accept what the savages themselves are able to tell us.
. . . &rsquo;&nbsp; Yes, we <i>must</i> learn and accept it; so I have
always urged.&nbsp; But if the savages tell us about totems, are they
not then &lsquo;casual native informants&rsquo;?&nbsp; If a Maori tells
you, as he does, of traditional hymns containing ideas worthy of Heraclitus,
is <i>that</i> quite trustworthy; whereas, if he tells you about his
idols and taboos, <i>that</i> cannot possibly be worthy of attention?</p>
<h3>Perception of the Infinite</h3>
<p>From these extraordinary examples of abstract thought in savages,
our author goes on to say that his theory of &lsquo;the perception of
the Infinite&rsquo; as the origin of religion was received &lsquo;with
a storm of unfounded obloquy&rsquo; (i. 292).&nbsp; I myself criticised
the <i>Hibbert</i> <i>Lectures</i>, in <i>Mind</i>; <a name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116">{116}</a>
on reading the essay over, I find no obloquy and no storm.&nbsp; I find,
however, that I deny, what our author says that I assert, the primitiveness
of contemporary savages.</p>
<p>In that essay, which, of course, our author had no reason to read,
much was said about fetishism, a topic discussed by Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
in his <i>Hibbert</i> <i>Lectures</i>.&nbsp; Fetishism is, as he says,
an ill word, and has caused much confusion.</p>
<h3>Fetishism and Anthropological Method</h3>
<p>Throughout much of his work our author&rsquo;s object is to invalidate
the anthropological method.&nbsp; That method sets side by side the
customs, ideas, fables, myths, proverbs, riddles, rites, of different
races.&nbsp; Of their <i>languages</i> it does not necessarily take
account in this process.&nbsp; Nobody (as we shall see) knows the languages
of all, or of most, of the races whose ideas he compares.&nbsp; Now
the learned professor establishes the &lsquo;harm done&rsquo; by our
method in a given instance.&nbsp; He seems to think that, if a method
has been misapplied, therefore the method itself is necessarily erroneous.&nbsp;
The case stands thus: De Brosses <a name="citation117a"></a><a href="#footnote117a">{117a}</a>
first compared &lsquo;the so-called fetishes&rsquo; of the Gold Coast
with Greek and Roman amulets and other material objects of old religions.&nbsp;
But he did this, we learn, without trying to find out <i>why</i> a negro
made a fetish of a pebble, shell, or tiger&rsquo;s tail, and without
endeavouring to discover whether the negro&rsquo;s motives really were
the motives of his &lsquo;postulated fetish worship&rsquo; in Greece,
Rome, or Palestine.</p>
<h3>Origin of Fetishes</h3>
<p>If so, <i>tant</i> <i>pis</i> <i>pour</i> <i>monsieur</i> <i>le</i>
<i>President</i>.&nbsp; But how does the unscientific conduct attributed
to De Brosses implicate the modern anthropologist?&nbsp; Do <i>we</i>
not try to find out, and really succeed sometimes in finding out, <i>why</i>
a savage cherishes this or that scrap as a &lsquo;fetish&rsquo;?&nbsp;
I give a string of explanations in <i>Custom</i> <i>and</i> <i>Myth</i>
(pp. 229-230).&nbsp; Sometimes the so-called fetish had an accidental,
which was taken to be a causal, connection with a stroke of good luck.&nbsp;
Sometimes the thing&mdash;an odd-shaped stone, say&mdash;had a superficial
resemblance to a desirable object, and so was thought likely to aid
in the acquisition of such objects by &lsquo;sympathetic magic.&rsquo;
<a name="citation117b"></a><a href="#footnote117b">{117b}</a></p>
<p>Other &lsquo;fetishes&rsquo; are revealed in dreams, or by ghosts,
or by spirits appearing in semblance of animals. <a name="citation118a"></a><a href="#footnote118a">{118a}</a></p>
<h3>&lsquo;Telekinetic&rsquo; Origin of Fetishism</h3>
<p>As I write comes in <i>M&eacute;lusine</i>, viii. 7, with an essay
by M. Lef&eacute;bure on <i>Les</i> <i>Origines</i> <i>du</i> <i>F&eacute;tichisme</i>.&nbsp;
He derives some fetishistic practices from what the Melanesians call
<i>Mana</i>, which, says Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, &lsquo;may often be rendered
by supernatural or magic power, present in an individual, a stone, or
in formulas or charms&rsquo; (i. 294).&nbsp; How, asks Mr. Lef&eacute;bure,
did men come to attribute this <i>vis</i> <i>vivida</i> to persons and
things?&nbsp; Because, in fact, he says, such an unexplored force does
really exist and display itself.&nbsp; He then cites Mr. Crookes&rsquo;
observations on scientifically registered &lsquo;telekinetic&rsquo;
performances by Daniel Dunglas Home, he cites Despine on Madame Schmitz-Baud,
<a name="citation118b"></a><a href="#footnote118b">{118b}</a> with examples
from Dr. Tylor, P. de la Rissach&egrave;re, Dr. Gibier, <a name="citation118c"></a><a href="#footnote118c">{118c}</a>
and other authorities, good or bad.&nbsp; Grouping, then, his facts
under the dubious title of <i>le</i> <i>magn&eacute;tisme</i>, M. Lef&eacute;bure
finds in savage observation of such facts &lsquo;the chief cause of
fetishism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some of M. Lef&eacute;bure&rsquo;s &lsquo;facts&rsquo; (of objects
moving untouched) were certainly frauds, like the tricks of Eusapia.&nbsp;
But, even if all the facts recorded were frauds, such impostures, performed
by savage conjurers, who certainly profess <a name="citation118d"></a><a href="#footnote118d">{118d}</a>
to produce the phenomena, might originate, or help to originate, the
respect paid to &lsquo;fetishes&rsquo; and the belief in <i>Mana</i>.&nbsp;
But probably Major Ellis&rsquo;s researches into the religion of the
Tshi-speaking races throw most light on the real ideas of African fetishists.&nbsp;
The subject is vast and complex.&nbsp; I am content to show that, whatever
De Brosses did, <i>we</i> do not abandon a search for the motives of
the savage fetishist.&nbsp; Indeed, De Brosses himself did seek and
find at least one African motive, &lsquo;The conjurers (<i>jongleurs</i>)
persuade them that little instruments in their possession are endowed
with a living spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp; So far, fetishism is spiritualism.</p>
<h3>Civilised &lsquo;Fetishism&rsquo;</h3>
<p>De Brosses did not look among civilised fetishists for the motives
which he neglected among savages (i. 196).&nbsp; <i>Tant</i> <i>pis</i>
<i>pour</i> <i>monsieur</i> <i>le</i> <i>Pr&eacute;sident</i>.&nbsp;
But we and our method no more stand or fall with De Brosses and his,
than Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s etymologies stand or fall with those
in the <i>Cratylus</i> of Plato.&nbsp; If, in a civilised people, ancient
or modern, we find a practice vaguely styled &lsquo;fetishistic,&rsquo;
we examine it in its details.&nbsp; While we have talismans, amulets,
gamblers&rsquo; <i>f&eacute;tiches</i>, I do not think that, except
among some children, we have anything nearly analogous to Gold Coast
fetishism as a whole.&nbsp; Some one seems to have called the <i>palladium</i>
a fetish.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t exactly know what the <i>palladium</i>
(called a fetish by somebody) was.&nbsp; The <i>hasta</i> <i>fetialis</i>
has been styled a fetish&mdash;an apparent abuse of language.&nbsp;
As to the Holy Cross <i>qua</i> fetish, why discuss such free-thinking
credulities?</p>
<p>Modern anthropologists&mdash;Tylor, Frazer, and the rest&mdash;are
not under the censure appropriate to the illogical.</p>
<h3>More Mischiefs of Comparison</h3>
<p>The &lsquo;Nemesis&rsquo; (i. 196) of De Brosses&rsquo; errors did
not stay in her ravaging progress.&nbsp; Fetishism was represented as
&lsquo;the very beginning of religion,&rsquo; first among the negroes,
then among all races.&nbsp; As I, for one, persistently proclaim that
the beginning of religion is an inscrutable mystery, the Nemesis has
somehow left me scatheless, propitiated by my piety.&nbsp; I said, long
ago, &lsquo;the train of ideas which leads man to believe in and to
treasure fetishes is <i>one</i> <i>among</i> <i>the</i> <i>earliest</i>
<i>springs</i> of religious belief.&rsquo; <a name="citation120a"></a><a href="#footnote120a">{120a}</a>&nbsp;
But from even this rather guarded statement I withdraw.&nbsp; &lsquo;No
man can watch the idea of GOD in the making or in the beginning.&rsquo;
<a name="citation120b"></a><a href="#footnote120b">{120b}</a></p>
<h3>Still more Nemesis</h3>
<p>The new Nemesis is really that which I have just put far from me&mdash;namely,
that &lsquo;modern savages represent everywhere the Eocene stratum of
religion.&rsquo;&nbsp; They <i>probably</i> represent an <i>early</i>
stage in religion, just as, <i>teste</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller,
they represent an early stage in language &lsquo;In savage languages
we see what we can no longer expect to see even in the most ancient
Sanskrit or Hebrew.&nbsp; We watch the childhood of language, with all
its childish pranks.&rsquo; <a name="citation120c"></a><a href="#footnote120c">{120c}</a></p>
<p>Now, if the tongues spoken by modern savages represent the &lsquo;childhood&rsquo;
and &lsquo;childish pranks&rsquo; of language, why should the beliefs
of modern savages not represent the childhood and childish pranks of
religion?&nbsp; I am not here averring that they do so, nor even that
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller is right in <i>his</i> remark on language.&nbsp;
The Australian blacks have been men as long as the Prussian nobility.&nbsp;
Their language has had time to outgrow &lsquo;childish pranks,&rsquo;
but apparently it has not made use of its opportunities, according to
our critic.&nbsp; Does he know why?</p>
<p>One need not reply to the charge that anthropologists, if they are
meant, regard modern savages &lsquo;as just evolved from the earth,
or the sky,&rsquo; or from monkeys (i. 197).&nbsp; &lsquo;Savages have
a far-stretching unknown history behind them.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The
past of savages, I say, must have been a long past.&rsquo; <a name="citation121"></a><a href="#footnote121">{121}</a>&nbsp;
So, once more, the Nemesis of De Brosses fails to touch me&mdash;and,
of course, to touch more learned anthropologists.</p>
<p>There is yet another Nemesis&mdash;the postulate that Aryans and
Semites, or rather their ancestors, must have passed through the savage
state.&nbsp; Dr. Tylor writes:&mdash;&lsquo;So far as history is to
be our criterion, progression is primary and degradation secondary.&nbsp;
<i>Culture</i> <i>must</i> <i>be</i> <i>gained</i> <i>before</i> <i>it</i>
<i>can</i> <i>be</i> <i>lost</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now a person who has
not gained what Dr. Tylor calls &lsquo;culture&rsquo; (<i>not</i> in
Mr. Arnold&rsquo;s sense) is a man without tools, instruments, or clothes.&nbsp;
He is certainly, so far, like a savage; is very much lower in &lsquo;culture&rsquo;
than any race with which we are acquainted.&nbsp; As a matter of hypothesis,
anyone may say that man was born &lsquo;with everything handsome about
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has then to account for the savage elements in
Greek myth and rite.</p>
<h3>For Us or Against Us?</h3>
<p>We now hear that the worst and last penalty paid for De Brosses&rsquo;
audacious comparison of savage with civilised superstitions is the postulate
that Aryan and Semitic peoples have passed through a stage of savagery.&nbsp;
&lsquo;However different the languages, customs and myths, the colour
and the skulls of these modern savages might be from those of Aryan
and Semitic people, the latter must once have passed through the same
stage, must once have been what the negroes of the West Coast of Africa
are to-day.&nbsp; This postulate has not been, and, according to its
very nature, cannot be proved.&nbsp; But the mischief done by acting
on such postulates is still going on, and in several cases it has come
to this&mdash;that what in historical religions, such as our own, is
known to be the most modern, the very last outcome, namely, the worship
of relics or a belief in amulets, has been represented as the first
necessary step in the evolution of all religions&rsquo; (i. 197).</p>
<p>I really do not know who says that the prehistoric ancestors of Aryans
and Semites were once in the same stage as the &lsquo;negroes of the
West Coast of Africa are to-day.&rsquo;&nbsp; These honest fellows are
well acquainted with coined money, with the use of firearms, and other
resources of civilisation, and have been in touch with missionaries,
Miss Kingsley, traders, and tourists.&nbsp; The ancestors of the Aryans
and Semites enjoyed no such advantages.&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller does
not tell us who says that they did.&nbsp; But that the ancestors of
all mankind passed through a stage in which they had to develop for
themselves tools, languages, clothes, and institutions, is assuredly
the belief of anthropologists.&nbsp; A race without tools, language,
clothes, pottery, and social institutions, or with these in the shape
of undeveloped speech, stone knives, and &rsquo;possum or other skins,
is what we call a race of savages.&nbsp; Such we believe the ancestors
of mankind to have been&mdash;at any rate after the Fall.</p>
<p>Now when Mr. Max M&uuml;ller began to write his book, he accepted
this postulate of anthropology (i. 15).&nbsp; When he reached i. 197
he abandoned and denounced this postulate.</p>
<p>I quote his acceptance of the postulate (i. 15):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Even Mr. A. Lang has to admit that we have not
got much beyond Fontenelle, when he wrote in the last century:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why are the legends [myths] about men, beasts, and
gods so wildly incredible and revolting? . . .&nbsp; The answer is that
the earliest men were in a state of almost inconceivable ignorance and
savagery, and that the Greeks inherited their myths from people in the
same savage stage (<i>en</i> <i>un</i> <i>pareil</i> <i>&eacute;tat</i>
<i>de</i> <i>sauvagerie</i>).&nbsp; Look at the Kaffirs and Iroquois
if you want to know what the earliest men were like, and remember that
the very Iroquois and Kaffirs have a long past behind them&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;that
is to say, are polite and cultivated compared to the earliest men of
all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is an uncompromising statement by Fontenelle of the postulate
that the Greeks (an Aryan people) must have passed through the same
stage as modern savages&mdash;Kaffirs and Iroquois&mdash;now occupy.&nbsp;
But (i. 15) Mr. Max M&uuml;ller eagerly accepts the postulate:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There is not a word of Fontenelle&rsquo;s to which
I should not gladly subscribe; there is no advice of his which I have
not tried to follow in all my attempts to explain the myths of India
and Greece by an occasional reference to Polynesian or African folklore.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, if Mr. Max M&uuml;ller &lsquo;gladly subscribes,&rsquo; in
p. 15, to the postulate of an original universal stage of savagery,
whence civilised races inherit their incredibly repulsive myths, why,
in pp. 197, 198, does he denounce that very postulate as not proven,
not capable of being proved, very mischievous, and one of the evils
resulting from our method of comparing savage and civilised rites and
beliefs?&nbsp; I must be permitted to complain that I do not know which
is Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s real opinion&mdash;that given with such
hearty conviction in p. 15, or that stated with no less earnestness
in pp. 197, 198.&nbsp; I trust that I shall not be thought to magnify
a mere slip of the pen.&nbsp; Both passages&mdash;though, as far as
I can see, self-contradictory&mdash;appear to be written with the same
absence of levity.&nbsp; Fontenelle, I own, speaks of Greeks, not Semites,
as being originally savages.&nbsp; But I pointed out <a name="citation124"></a><a href="#footnote124">{124}</a>
that he considered it safer to &lsquo;hedge&rsquo; by making an exception
of the Israelites.&nbsp; There is really nothing in Genesis against
the contention that the naked, tool-less, mean, and frivolous Adam was
a savage.</p>
<h3>The Fallacy of &lsquo;Admits&rsquo;</h3>
<p>As the purpose of this essay is mainly logical, I may point out the
existence of a fallacy not marked, I think, in handbooks of Logic.&nbsp;
This is the fallacy of saying that an opponent &lsquo;admits&rsquo;
what, on the contrary, he has been the first to point out and proclaim.&nbsp;
He is thus suggested into an attitude which is the reverse of his own.&nbsp;
Some one&mdash;I am sorry to say that I forget who he was&mdash;showed
me that Fontenelle, in <i>De</i> <i>l&rsquo;Origine</i> <i>des</i> <i>Fables</i>,
<a name="citation125a"></a><a href="#footnote125a">{125a}</a> briefly
stated the anthropological theory of the origin of myths, or at least
of that repulsive element in them which &lsquo;makes mythology mythological,&rsquo;
as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller says.&nbsp; I was glad to have a predecessor
in a past less remote than that of Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A briefer and better system of mythology,&rsquo; I wrote, &lsquo;could
not be devised; but the Mr. Casaubons of this world have neglected it,
and even now it is beyond their comprehension.&rsquo; <a name="citation125b"></a><a href="#footnote125b">{125b}</a>&nbsp;
To say this in this manner is not to &lsquo;<i>admit</i> that we have
not got much beyond Fontenelle.&rsquo;&nbsp; I do not want to get beyond
Fontenelle.&nbsp; I want to go back to his &lsquo;forgotten common-sense,&rsquo;
and to apply his ideas with method and criticism to a range of materials
which he did not possess or did not investigate.</p>
<p>Now, on p. 15, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller had got as far as accepting Fontenelle;
on pp. 197, 198 he burns, as it were, that to which he had &lsquo;gladly
subscribed.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Conclusion as to our Method</h3>
<p>All this discussion of fetishes arose out of our author&rsquo;s selection
of the subject as an example of the viciousness of our method.&nbsp;
He would not permit us &lsquo;simply to place side by side&rsquo; savage
and Greek myths and customs, because it did harm (i. 195); and the harm
done was proved by the Nemesis of De Brosses.&nbsp; Now, first, a method
may be a good method, yet may be badly applied.&nbsp; Secondly, I have
shown that the Nemesis does not attach to all of us modern anthropologists.&nbsp;
Thirdly, I have proved (unless I am under some misapprehension, which
I vainly attempt to detect, and for which, if it exists, I apologise
humbly) that Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, on p. 15, accepts the doctrine which
he denounces on p. 197. <a name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126">{126}</a>&nbsp;
Again, I am entirely at one with Mr. Max M&uuml;ller when he says (p.
210) &lsquo;we have as yet really no scientific treatment of Shamanism.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This is a pressing need, but probably a physician alone could do the
work&mdash;a physician <i>doubl&eacute;</i> with a psychologist.&nbsp;
See, however, the excellent pages in Dr. Tylor&rsquo;s <i>Primitive</i>
<i>Culture</i>, and in Mr. William James&rsquo;s <i>Principles</i> <i>of</i>
<i>Psychology</i>, on &lsquo;Mediumship.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>THE RIDDLE THEORY</h2>
<h3>What the Philological Theory Needs</h3>
<p>The great desideratum of the philological method is a proof that
the &lsquo;Disease of Language,&rsquo; <i>ex</i> <i>hypothesi</i> the
most fertile source of myths, is a <i>vera</i> <i>causa</i>.&nbsp; Do
simple poetical phrases, descriptive of heavenly phenomena, remain current
in the popular mouth after the meanings of appellatives (Bright One,
Dark One, &amp;c.) have been forgotten, so that these appellatives become
proper names&mdash;Apollo, Daphne, &amp;c.?&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
seems to think some proof of this process as a <i>vera</i> <i>causa</i>
may be derived from &lsquo;Folk Riddles.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>The Riddle Theory</h3>
<p>We now come, therefore, to the author&rsquo;s treatment of popular
riddles (<i>devinettes</i>), so common among savages and peasants.&nbsp;
Their construction is simple: anything in Nature you please is described
by a poetical periphrasis, and you are asked what it is.&nbsp; Thus
Geistiblindr asks,</p>
<blockquote><p>What is the Dark One<br />
That goes over the earth,<br />
Swallows water and wood,<br />
But is afraid of the wind? &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or we find,</p>
<blockquote><p>What is the gold spun from one window to another?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answers, the obvious answers, are (1) &lsquo;mist&rsquo; and
(2) &lsquo;sunshine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s opinion these riddles &lsquo;could
not but lead to what we call popular myths or legends.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Very probably; but this does not aid us to accept the philological method.&nbsp;
The very essence of that method is the presumed absolute loss of the
meaning of, <i>e</i>.<i>g</i>. &lsquo;the Dark One.&rsquo;&nbsp; Before
there can be a myth, <i>ex</i> <i>hypothesi</i> the words <i>Dark</i>
<i>One</i> must have become hopelessly unintelligible, must have become
a proper name.&nbsp; Thus suppose, for argument&rsquo;s sake only, that
Cronos once meant <i>Dark</i> <i>One</i>, and was understood in that
sense.&nbsp; People (as in the Norse riddle just cited) said, &lsquo;Cronos
[<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. the <i>Dark</i> <i>One</i>&mdash;meaning mist] swallows
water and wood.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then they forgot that Cronos was their
old word for the Dark One, and was mist; but they kept up, and understood,
all the rest of the phrase about what mist does.&nbsp; The expression
now ran, &lsquo;Cronos [whatever that may be] swallows water and wood.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But water comes from mist, and water nourishes wood, therefore &lsquo;Cronos
swallows his children.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such would be the development of
a myth on Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s system.&nbsp; He would interpret
&lsquo;Cronos swallows his children,&rsquo; by finding, if he could,
the original meaning of Cronos.&nbsp; Let us say that he did discover
it to mean &lsquo;the Dark One.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he might think Cronos
meant &lsquo;night;&rsquo; &lsquo;mist&rsquo; he would hardly guess.</p>
<p>That is all very clear, but the point is this&mdash;in <i>devinettes</i>,
or riddles, the meaning of &lsquo;the Dark One&rsquo; is <i>not</i>
lost:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Thy riddle is <i>easy</i><br />
Blind Gest,<br />
To read&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heidrick answers.</p>
<p>What the philological method of mythology needs is to prove that
such poetical statements about natural phenomena as the <i>devinettes</i>
contain survived in the popular mouth, and were perfectly intelligible
except just the one <i>mot</i> <i>d&rsquo;&eacute;nigme</i>&mdash;say,
&lsquo;the Dark One.&rsquo;&nbsp; That (call it Cronos=&lsquo;Dark One&rsquo;),
and that alone, became unintelligible in the changes of language, and
so had to be accepted as a proper name, Cronos&mdash;a god who swallows
things at large.</p>
<p>Where is the proof of such endurance of intelligible phrases with
just the one central necessary word obsolete and changed into a mysterious
proper name?&nbsp; The world is full of proper names which have lost
their meaning&mdash;Athene, Achilles, Artemis, and so on but we need
proof that poetical sayings, or riddles, survive and are intelligible
except one word, which, being unintelligible, becomes a proper name.&nbsp;
Riddles, of course, prove nothing of this kind:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Thy riddle is easy<br />
Blind Gest<br />
To read!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet Mr. Max M&uuml;ller offers the suggestion that the obscurity
of many of these names of mythical gods and heroes &lsquo;may be due
. . . to the riddles to which they had given rise, and which would have
ceased to be riddles if the names had been clear and intelligible, like
those of Helios and Selene&rsquo; (i. 92).&nbsp; People, he thinks,
in making riddles &lsquo;would avoid the ordinary appellatives, and
the use of little-known names in most mythologies would thus find an
intelligible explanation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, &lsquo;we can see how
essential it was that in such mythological riddles the principal agents
should not be called by their regular names.&rsquo;&nbsp; This last
remark, indeed, is obvious.&nbsp; To return to the Norse riddle of the
Dark One that swallows wood and water.&nbsp; It would never do in a
riddle to call the Dark One by his ordinary name, &lsquo;Mist.&rsquo;&nbsp;
You would not amuse a rural audience by asking &lsquo;What is the mist
that swallows wood and water?&rsquo;&nbsp; That would be even easier
than Mr. Burnand&rsquo;s riddle for very hot weather:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My first is a boot, my second is a jack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conceivably Mr. Max M&uuml;ller may mean that in riddles an almost
obsolete word was used to designate the object.&nbsp; Perhaps, instead
of &lsquo;the Dark One,&rsquo; a peasant would say, &lsquo;What is the
Rooky One?&rsquo;&nbsp; But as soon as nobody knew what &lsquo;the Rooky
One&rsquo; meant, the riddle would cease to exist&mdash;Rooky One and
all.&nbsp; You cannot imagine several generations asking each other&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>What is the Rooky One that swallows?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>if nobody knew the answer.&nbsp; A man who kept boring people with
a mere &lsquo;sell&rsquo; would be scouted; and with the death of the
answerless riddle the difficult word &lsquo;Rooky&rsquo; would die.&nbsp;
But Mr. Max M&uuml;ller says, &lsquo;Riddles would cease to be riddles
if the names had been clear and intelligible.&rsquo;&nbsp; The reverse
is the fact.&nbsp; In the riddles he gives there are seldom any &lsquo;names;&rsquo;
but the epithets and descriptions are as clear as words can be:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Who are the mother and children in a house, all having
bald heads?&mdash;The moon and stars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Language cannot be clearer.&nbsp; Yet the riddle has not &lsquo;ceased
to be a riddle,&rsquo; as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller thinks it must do, though
the words are &lsquo;clear and intelligible.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the other
hand, if the language is <i>not</i> clear and intelligible, the riddle
would cease to exist.&nbsp; It would not amuse if nobody understood
it.&nbsp; You might as well try to make yourself socially acceptable
by putting conundrums in Etruscan as by asking riddles in words not
clear and intelligible in themselves, though obscure in their reference.&nbsp;
The difficulty of a riddle consists, not in the obscurity of words or
names, but in the description of familiar things by terms, clear as
terms, denoting their appearance and action.&nbsp; The mist is described
as &lsquo;dark,&rsquo; &lsquo;swallowing,&rsquo; &lsquo;one that fears
the wind,&rsquo; and so forth.&nbsp; The <i>words</i> are pellucid.</p>
<p>Thus &lsquo;ordinary appellatives&rsquo; (i. 99) are <i>not</i> &lsquo;avoided&rsquo;
in riddles, though <i>names</i> (sun, mist) cannot be used in the question
because they give the answer to the riddle.</p>
<p>For all these reasons ancient riddles cannot explain the obscurity
of mythological names.&nbsp; As soon as the name was too obscure, the
riddle and the name would be forgotten, would die together.&nbsp; So
we know as little as ever of the purely hypothetical process by which
a riddle, or popular poetical saying, remains intelligible in a language,
while the <i>mot</i> <i>d&rsquo;&eacute;nigme</i>, becoming unintelligible,
turns into a proper name&mdash;say, Cronos.&nbsp; Yet the belief in
this process as a <i>vera</i> <i>causa</i> is essential to our author&rsquo;s
method.</p>
<p>Here Mr. Max M&uuml;ller warns us that his riddle theory is not meant
to explain &lsquo;the obscurities of <i>all</i> mythological names.&nbsp;
This is a stratagem that should be stopped from the very first.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It were more graceful to have said &lsquo;a misapprehension.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another &lsquo;stratagem&rsquo; I myself must guard against.&nbsp;
I do not say that <i>no</i> unintelligible strings of obsolete words
may continue to live in the popular mouth.&nbsp; Old hymns, ritual speeches,
and charms may and do survive, though unintelligible.&nbsp; They are
reckoned all the more potent, because all the more mysterious.&nbsp;
But an unintelligible riddle or poetical saying does not survive, so
we cannot thus account for mythology as a disease of language.</p>
<h3>Mordvinian Mythology</h3>
<p>Still in the very natural and laudable pursuit of facts which will
support the hypothesis of a disease of language, Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
turns to Mordvinian mythology.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have the accounts of
real scholars&rsquo; about Mordvinian prayers, charms, and proverbs
(i. 235).&nbsp; The Mordvinians, Ugrian tribes, have the usual departmental
Nature-gods&mdash;as Chka&iuml;, god of the sun (<i>chi</i>=sun).&nbsp;
He &lsquo;lives in the sun, or is the sun&rsquo; (i. 236).&nbsp; His
wife is the Earth or earth goddess, V&eacute;diava.&nbsp; They have
a large family, given to incest.&nbsp; The morals of the Mordvinian
gods are as lax as those of Mordvinian mortals.&nbsp; (Compare the myths
and morals of Samos, and the Samian Hera.)&nbsp; Athwart the decent
god Chka&iuml; comes the evil god Chaitan&mdash;obviously Shaitan, a
Mahommedan contamination.&nbsp; There are plenty of minor gods, and
spirits good and bad.&nbsp; Dawn was a Mordvinian girl; in Australia
she was a <i>lubra</i> addicted to lubricity.</p>
<p><i>How</i> <i>does</i> <i>this</i> <i>help</i> <i>philological</i>
<i>mythology</i>?</p>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller is pleased to find solar and other elemental
gods among the Mordvinians.&nbsp; But the discovery in no way aids his
special theory.&nbsp; Nobody has ever denied that gods who are the sun
or live in the sun are familiar, and are the centres of myths among
most races.&nbsp; I give examples in <i>C</i>. <i>and</i> <i>M</i>.
(pp. 104, 133, New Zealand and North America) and in <i>M</i>. <i>R</i>.
<i>R</i>. (i. 124-135, America, Africa, Australia, Aztec, Hervey Islands,
Samoa, and so on).&nbsp; Such Nature-myths&mdash;of sun, sky, earth&mdash;are
perhaps universal; but they do not arise from disease of language.&nbsp;
These myths deal with natural phenomena plainly and explicitly.&nbsp;
The same is the case among the Mordvinians.&nbsp; &lsquo;The few names
preserved to us are clearly the names of the agents behind the salient
phenomena of Nature, in some cases quite intelligible, in others easily
restored to their original meaning.&rsquo;&nbsp; The meanings of the
names not being forgotten, but obvious, there is no disease of language.&nbsp;
All this does not illustrate the case of Greek divine names by resemblance,
but by difference.&nbsp; Real scholars know what Mordvinian divine names
mean.&nbsp; They do not know what many Greek divine names mean&mdash;as
Hera, Artemis, Apollo, Athene; there is even much dispute about Demeter.</p>
<p>No anthropologist, I hope, is denying that Nature-myths and Nature-gods
exist.&nbsp; We are only fighting against the philological effort to
get at the elemental phenomena which may be behind Hera, Artemis, Athene,
Apollo, by means of contending etymological conjectures.&nbsp; We only
oppose the philological attempt to account for all the features in a
god&rsquo;s myth as manifestations of the elemental qualities denoted
by a name which may mean at pleasure dawn, storm, clear air, thunder,
wind, twilight, water, or what you will.&nbsp; Granting Chka&iuml; to
be the sun, does that explain why he punishes people who bake bread
on Friday? (237.)&nbsp; Our opponent does not seem to understand the
<i>port&eacute;e</i> of our objections.&nbsp; The same remarks apply
to the statement of Finnish mythology here given, and familiar in the
<i>Kalewala</i>.&nbsp; Departmental divine beings of natural phenomena
we find everywhere, or nearly everywhere, in company, of course, with
other elements of belief&mdash;totemism, worship of spirits, perhaps
with monotheism in the background.&nbsp; That is as much our opinion
as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s.&nbsp; What we are opposing is the theory
of disease of language, and the attempt to explain, by philological
conjectures, gods and heroes whose obscure <i>names</i> are the only
sources of information.</p>
<p>Helios is the sun-god; he is, or lives in, the sun.&nbsp; Apollo
may have been the sun-god too, but we still distrust the attempts to
prove this by contending guesses at the origin of his name.&nbsp; Moreover,
if all Greek gods could be certainly explained, by undisputed etymologies,
as originally elemental, we still object to such logic as that which
turns Saranyu into &lsquo;grey dawn.&rsquo;&nbsp; We still object to
the competing interpretations by which almost every detail of very composite
myths is explained as a poetical description of some elemental process
or phenomenon.&nbsp; Apollo <i>may</i> once have been the sun, but why
did he make love as a dog?</p>
<h3>Lettish Mythology</h3>
<p>These remarks apply equally well to our author&rsquo;s dissertation
on Lettish mythology (ii. 430 <i>et</i> <i>seq</i>.).&nbsp; The meaning
of statements about the sun and sky &lsquo;is not to be mistaken in
the mythology of the Letts.&rsquo;&nbsp; So here is no disease of language.&nbsp;
The meaning is not to be mistaken.&nbsp; Sun and moon and so on are
spoken of by their natural unmistakable names, or in equally unmistakable
poetical periphrases, as in riddles.&nbsp; The daughter of the sun hung
a red cloak on a great oak-tree.&nbsp; This &lsquo;can hardly have been
meant for anything but the red of the evening or the setting sun, sometimes
called her red cloak&rsquo; (ii. 439).&nbsp; Exactly so, and the Australians
of Encounter Bay also think that the sun is a woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;She
has a lover among the dead, who has given her a red kangaroo skin, and
in this she appears at her rising.&rsquo; <a name="citation135"></a><a href="#footnote135">{135}</a>&nbsp;
This tale was told to Mr. Meyer in 1846, before Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
<i>Dawn</i> had become &lsquo;inevitable,&rsquo; as he says.</p>
<p>The Lettish and Australian myths are folk-poetry; they have nothing
to do with a disease of language or forgotten meanings of words which
become proper names.&nbsp; All this is surely distinct.&nbsp; We proclaim
the abundance of poetical Nature-myths; we &lsquo;disable&rsquo; the
hypothesis that they arise from a disease of language.</p>
<h3>The Chances of Fancy</h3>
<p>One remark has to be added.&nbsp; Mannhardt regarded many or most
of the philological solutions of gods into dawn or sun, or thunder or
cloud, as empty <i>jeux</i> <i>d&rsquo;esprit</i>.&nbsp; And justly,
for there is no name named among men which a philologist cannot easily
prove to be a synonym or metaphorical term for wind or weather, dawn
or sun.&nbsp; Whatever attribute any word connotes, it can be shown
to connote some attribute of dawn or sun.&nbsp; Here parody comes in,
and gives a not overstrained copy of the method, applying it to Mr.
Gladstone, Dr. Nansen, or whom you please.&nbsp; And though a jest is
not a refutation, a parody may plainly show the absolutely capricious
character of the philological method.</p>
<h2>ARTEMIS</h2>
<p>I do not here examine our author&rsquo;s constructive work.&nbsp;
I have often criticised its logical method before, and need not repeat
myself.&nbsp; The etymologies, of course, I leave to be discussed by
scholars.&nbsp; As we have seen, they are at odds on the subject of
phonetic laws and their application to mythological names.&nbsp; On
the mosses and bogs of this Debatable Land some of them propose to erect
the science of comparative mythology.&nbsp; Meanwhile we look on, waiting
till the mosses shall support a ponderous edifice.</p>
<p>Our author&rsquo;s treatment of Artemis, however, has for me a peculiar
interest (ii. 733-743).&nbsp; I really think that it is not mere vanity
which makes me suppose that in this instance I am at least one of the
authors whom Mr. Max M&uuml;ller is writing <i>about</i> without name
or reference.&nbsp; If so, he here sharply distinguishes between me
on the one hand and &lsquo;classical scholars&rsquo; on the other, a
point to which we shall return.&nbsp; He says&mdash;I cite textually
(ii. 732):&mdash;</p>
<h3>Artemis</h3>
<p>&lsquo;The last of the great Greek goddesses whom we have to consider
is Artemis.&nbsp; Her name, we shall see, has received many interpretations,
but none that can be considered as well established&mdash;none that,
even if it were so, would help us much in disentangling the many myths
told about her.&nbsp; Easy to understand as her character seems when
we confine our attention to Homer, it becomes extremely complicated
when we take into account the numerous local forms of worship of which
she was the object.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have here a good opportunity of comparing the interpretations
put forward by <i>those</i> <i>who</i> <i>think</i> <i>that</i> <i>a</i>
<i>study</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>myths</i> <i>and</i> <i>customs</i>
<i>of</i> <i>uncivilised</i> <i>tribes</i> <i>can</i> <i>help</i> <i>us</i>
<i>towards</i> <i>an</i> <i>understanding</i> <i>of</i> <i>Greek</i>
<i>deities</i>, <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>views</i> <i>advocated</i>
<i>by</i> <i>classical</i> <i>scholars</i> <a name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138">{138}</a>
who draw their information, first of all, from Greek sources, and afterwards
only from a comparison of the myths and customs of cognate races, more
particularly from what is preserved to us in ancient Vedic literature,
before they plunge into the whirlpool of ill-defined and unintelligible
Kafir folklore.&nbsp; The former undertake to explain Artemis by showing
us the progress of human intelligence from the coarsest spontaneous
and primitive ideas to the most beautiful and brilliant conception of
poets and sculptors.&nbsp; They point out traces of hideous cruelties
amounting almost to cannibalism, and of a savage cult of beasts in the
earlier history of the goddess, who was celebrated by dances of young
girls disguised as bears or imitating the movements of bears, &amp;c.&nbsp;
She was represented as &pi;&omicron;&lambda;&upsilon;&mu;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
and this idea, we are told, was borrowed from the East, which is a large
term.&nbsp; We are told that her most ancient history is to be studied
in Arkadia, where we can see the goddess still closely connected with
the worship of animals, a characteristic feature of the lowest stage
of religious worship among the lowest races of mankind.&nbsp; We are
then told the old story of Lyk&acirc;on, the King of Arkadia, who had
a beautiful daughter called Kallisto.&nbsp; As Zeus fell in love with
her, H&ecirc;ra from jealousy changed her into a bear, and Artemis killed
her with one of her arrows.&nbsp; Her child, however, was saved by Hermes,
at the command of Zeus; and while Kallisto was changed to the constellation
of the Ursa, her son Arkas became the ancestor of the Arkadians.&nbsp;
Here, we are told, we have a clear instance of men being the descendants
of animals, and of women being changed into wild beasts and stars&mdash;beliefs
well known among the Cahrocs and the Kamilarois.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Here I recognise Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s version of my remarks
on Artemis. <a name="citation139a"></a><a href="#footnote139a">{139a}</a>&nbsp;
Our author has just remarked in a footnote that Schwartz &lsquo;does
not mention the title of the book where his evidence has been given.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It <i>is</i> an inconvenient practice, but with Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
this reticence is by no means unusual.&nbsp; <i>He</i> &lsquo;does not
mention the book where &lsquo;my &lsquo;evidence is given.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anthropologists are here (unless I am mistaken) contrasted with &lsquo;classical
scholars who draw their information, first of all, from Greek sources.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I need not assure anyone who has looked into my imperfect works that
I also drew my information about Artemis &lsquo;first of all from Greek
sources,&rsquo; in the original.&nbsp; Many of these sources, to the
best of my knowledge, are not translated: one, Homer, I have translated
myself, with Professor Butcher and Messrs. Leaf and Myers, my old friends.</p>
<p>The idea and representation of Artemis as &pi;&omicron;&lambda;&upsilon;&mu;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;
(many-breasted), &lsquo;we are told, was borrowed from the East, a large
term.&rsquo;&nbsp; I say &lsquo;she is even blended in ritual with a
monstrous many-breasted divinity of Oriental religion.&rsquo; <a name="citation139b"></a><a href="#footnote139b">{139b}</a>&nbsp;
Is this &lsquo;large term&rsquo; too vague?&nbsp; Then consider the
Artemis of Ephesus and &lsquo;the alabaster statuette of the goddess&rsquo;
in Roscher&rsquo;s <i>Lexikon</i>, p. 558.&nbsp; Compare, for an Occidental
parallel, the many-breasted goddess of the maguey plant, in Mexico.
<a name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140">{140}</a>&nbsp; Our
author writes, &lsquo;we are told that Artemis&rsquo;s most ancient
history is to be studied in Arkadia.&rsquo;&nbsp; My words are, &lsquo;The
<i>Attic</i> and Arcadian legends of Artemis are confessedly <i>among</i>
<i>the</i> <i>oldest</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Why should &lsquo;Attic&rsquo;
and the qualifying phrase be omitted?</p>
<h3>Otfried M&uuml;ller</h3>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller goes on&mdash;citing, as I also do, Otfried M&uuml;ller:&mdash;&lsquo;Otfried
M&uuml;ller in 1825 treated the same myth without availing himself of
the light now to be derived from the Cahrocs and the Kamilarois.&nbsp;
He quoted Pausanias as stating that the tumulus of Kallisto was near
the sanctuary of Artemis Kallist&ecirc;, and he simply took Kallisto
for an epithet of Artemis, which, as in many other cases, had been taken
for a separate personality.&rsquo;&nbsp; Otfried also pointed out, as
we both say, that at Brauron, in Attica, Artemis was served by young
maidens called &alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&iota; (bears); and
he concluded, &lsquo;This cannot possibly be a freak of chance, but
the metamorphosis [of Kallisto] has its foundation in the fact that
the animal [the bear] was sacred to the goddess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus it is acknowledged that Artemis, under her name of Callisto,
was changed into a she-bear, and had issue, Arkas&mdash;whence the Arcadians.&nbsp;
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller proceeds (ii. 734)&mdash;&lsquo;He [Otfried] did
not go so far as some modern mythologists who want us to believe that
originally the animal, the she-bear, was the goddess, and that a later
worship had replaced the ancient worship of the animal <i>pur</i> <i>et</i>
<i>simple</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Did I, then, tell anybody that &lsquo;originally the she-bear was
the goddess&rsquo;?&nbsp; No, I gave my reader, not a dogma, but the
choice between two alternative hypotheses.&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;It will
become probable that the she-bear actually <i>was</i> the goddess at
an extremely remote period, or at all events that the goddess succeeded
to, and threw her protection over, an ancient worship of the animal&rsquo;
(ii. 212, 213).</p>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s error, it will be observed, consists
in writing &lsquo;and&rsquo; where I wrote &lsquo;or.&rsquo;&nbsp; To
make such rather essential mistakes is human; to give references is
convenient, and not unscholarly.</p>
<p>In fact, this is Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s own opinion, for he
next reports his anonymous author (myself) as saying (&lsquo;we are
now told&rsquo;), &lsquo;though without any reference to Pausanias or
any other Greek writers, that the young maidens, the &alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&iota;,
when dancing around Artemis, were clad in bearskins, and that this is
a pretty frequent custom in the dances of totemic races.&nbsp; In support
of this, however, we are not referred to really totemic races . . .
but to the Hirpi of Italy, and to the &Delta;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&kappa;&omega;&delta;&omega;&nu; in Egypt.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course I
never said that the &alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&iota; danced around
Artemis!&nbsp; I did say, after observing that they were described as
&lsquo;playing the bear,&rsquo; &lsquo;they even in archaic ages wore
bear-skins,&rsquo; for which I cited Claus <a name="citation141a"></a><a href="#footnote141a">{141a}</a>
and referred to Suchier, <a name="citation141b"></a><a href="#footnote141b">{141b}</a>
including the reference in brackets [ ] to indicate that I borrowed
it from a book which I was unable to procure. <a name="citation142a"></a><a href="#footnote142a">{142a}</a>&nbsp;
I then gave references for the classical use of a saffron vest by the
&alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&iota;.</p>
<h3>Beast Dances</h3>
<p>For the use of beast-skins in such dances among totemists I cite
Bancroft (iii. 168) and (<i>M</i>. <i>R</i>. <i>R</i>. ii. 107) Robinson
<a name="citation142b"></a><a href="#footnote142b">{142b}</a> (same
authority).&nbsp; I may now also refer to Robertson Smith: <a name="citation142c"></a><a href="#footnote142c">{142c}</a>
&lsquo;the meaning of such a disguise [a fish-skin, among the Assyrians]
<i>is</i> <i>well</i> <i>known</i> <i>from</i> <i>many</i> <i>savage</i>
<i>rituals</i>; it means that the worshipper presents himself as a fish,&rsquo;
as a bear, or what not. <a name="citation142d"></a><a href="#footnote142d">{142d}</a>&nbsp;
Doubtless I might have referred more copiously to savage rituals, but
really I thought that savage dances in beast-skins were familiar from
Catlin&rsquo;s engravings of Mandan and Nootka wolf or buffalo dances.&nbsp;
I add that the Brauronian rites &lsquo;point to a time when the goddess
was herself a bear,&rsquo; having suggested an alternative theory, and
added confirmation. <a name="citation142e"></a><a href="#footnote142e">{142e}</a>&nbsp;
But I here confess that while beast-dances and wearing of skins of sacred
beasts are common, to prove these sacred beasts to be totems is another
matter.&nbsp; It is so far inferred rather than demonstrated.&nbsp;
Next I said that the evolution of the bear into the classical Artemis
&lsquo;almost escapes our inquiry.&nbsp; We find nothing more akin to
it than the relation borne by the Samoan gods to the various totems
in which they are supposed to be manifest.&rsquo;&nbsp; This Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller quotes (of course, without reference or marks of quotation)
and adds, &lsquo;<i>pace</i> Dr. Codrington.&rsquo;&nbsp; Have I incurred
Dr. Codrington&rsquo;s feud?&nbsp; He doubts or denies totems in Melanesia.&nbsp;
Is Samoa in Melanesia, <i>par</i> <i>exemple</i>? <a name="citation143a"></a><a href="#footnote143a">{143a}</a>&nbsp;
Our author (i. 206) says that &lsquo;Dr. Codrington will have no totems
in his islands.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Samoa is not one of the doctor&rsquo;s
fortunate isles.&nbsp; For Samoa I refer, not to Dr. Codrington, but
to Mr. Turner. <a name="citation143b"></a><a href="#footnote143b">{143b}</a>&nbsp;
In Samoa the &lsquo;clans&rsquo; revere each its own sacred animals,
&lsquo;but combine with it the belief that the spiritual deity reveals
itself in each separate animal.&rsquo; <a name="citation143c"></a><a href="#footnote143c">{143c}</a>&nbsp;
I expressly contrast the Samoan creed with &lsquo;pure totemism.&rsquo;
<a name="citation143d"></a><a href="#footnote143d">{143d}</a></p>
<p>So much for our author&rsquo;s success in stating and criticising
my ideas.&nbsp; If he pleases, I will not speak of Samoan totems, but
of Samoan sacred animals.&nbsp; It is better and more exact.</p>
<h3>The View of Classical Scholars</h3>
<p>They (ii. 735) begin by pointing out Artemis&rsquo;s connection with
Apollo and the moon.&nbsp; So do I!&nbsp; &lsquo;If Apollo soon disengages
himself from the sun . . .&nbsp; Artemis retains as few traces of any
connection with the moon.&rsquo; <a name="citation143e"></a><a href="#footnote143e">{143e}</a>&nbsp;
&lsquo;If Apollo was of solar origin,&rsquo; asks the author (ii. 735),
&lsquo;what could his sister Artemis have been, from the very beginning,
if not some goddess connected with the moon?&rsquo;&nbsp; Very likely;
<i>quis</i> <i>negavit</i>?&nbsp; Then our author, like myself (<i>loc</i>.
<i>cit</i>.), dilates on Artemis as &lsquo;sister of Apollo.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Her chapels,&rsquo; I say, &lsquo;are in the wild wood; she is
the abbess of the forest nymphs,&rsquo; &lsquo;chaste and fair, the
maiden of the precise life.&rsquo;&nbsp; How odd!&nbsp; The classical
scholar and I both say the same things; and I add a sonnet to Artemis
in this aspect, rendered by me from the <i>Hippolytus</i> of Euripides.&nbsp;
Could a classical scholar do more?&nbsp; Our author then says that the
Greek sportsman &lsquo;surprised the beasts in their lairs&rsquo; by
night.&nbsp; Not very sportsmanlike!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t find it in
Homer or in Xenophon.&nbsp; Oh for exact references!&nbsp; The moon,
the nocturnal sportswoman, is Artemis: here we have also the authority
of Th&eacute;odore de Banville (<i>Diane</i> <i>court</i> <i>dans</i>
<i>la</i> <i>noire</i> <i>for&ecirc;t</i>).&nbsp; And the nocturnal
hunt <i>is</i> <i>Dian&rsquo;s</i>; so she is protectress of the chase.&nbsp;
Exactly what I said! <a name="citation144a"></a><a href="#footnote144a">{144a}</a></p>
<p>All this being granted by me beforehand (though possibly that might
not be guessed from my critic), our author will explain Artemis&rsquo;s
human sacrifice of a girl in a fawn-skin&mdash;bloodshed, bear and all&mdash;with
no aid from Kamilarois, Cahrocs, and Samoans.</p>
<h3>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s Explanation</h3>
<p>Greek races traced to Zeus&mdash;usually disguised, for amorous purposes,
as a brute.&nbsp; The Arcadians had an eponymous heroic ancestor, &lsquo;Areas;&rsquo;
they also worshipped Artemis.&nbsp; Artemis, as a virgin, could not
become a mother of Areas by Zeus, or by anybody.&nbsp; Callisto was
also Artemis.&nbsp; Callisto was the mother of Areas.&nbsp; But, to
save the character of Artemis, Callisto was now represented as one of
her nymphs.&nbsp; Then, Areas reminding the Arcadians of &alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;
(a bear), while they knew the Bear constellation, &lsquo;what was more
natural than that Callisto should be changed into an <i>arktos</i>,
a she-bear . . . placed by Zeus, her lover, in the sky&rsquo; as the
Bear?</p>
<p>Nothing could be more natural to a savage; they all do it. <a name="citation144b"></a><a href="#footnote144b">{144b}</a>&nbsp;
But that an Aryan, a Greek, should talk such nonsense as to say that
he was the descendant of a bear who was changed into a star, and all
merely because &lsquo;Areas reminded the Arcadians of <i>arktos</i>,&rsquo;
seems to me an extreme test of belief, and a very unlikely thing to
occur.</p>
<h3>Wider Application of the Theory</h3>
<p>Let us apply the explanation more widely.&nbsp; Say that a hundred
animal names are represented in the known totem-kindreds of the world.&nbsp;
Then had each such kin originally an eponymous hero whose name, like
that of Areas in Arcady, accidentally &lsquo;reminded&rsquo; his successors
of a beast, so that a hundred beasts came to be claimed as ancestors?&nbsp;
Perhaps this was what occurred; the explanation, at all events, fits
the wolf of the Delawares and the other ninety-nine as well as it fits
the Arcades.&nbsp; By a curious coincidence all the names of eponymous
heroes chanced to remind people of beasts.&nbsp; But <i>whence</i> <i>come</i>
<i>the</i> <i>names</i> <i>of</i> <i>eponymous</i> <i>heroes</i>?&nbsp;
From their tribes, of course&mdash;Ion from Ionians, Dorus from Dorians,
and so on.&nbsp; Therefore (in the hundred cases) the names of the <i>tribes</i>
derive from names of animals.&nbsp; Indeed, the names of totem-kins
<i>are</i> the names of animals&mdash;wolves, bears, cranes.&nbsp; Mr.
Max M&uuml;ller remarks that the name &lsquo;Arcades&rsquo; <i>may</i>
come from &alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;, a bear (i. 738);
so the Arcadians (Proselenoi, the oldest of races, &lsquo;men before
the moon&rsquo;) may be&mdash;Bears.&nbsp; So, of course (in this case),
they would necessarily be Bears <i>before</i> they invented Areas, an
eponymous hero whose name is derived from the pre-existing tribal name.&nbsp;
His name, then, could not, before they invented it, remind them of a
bear.&nbsp; It was from their name &Alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&iota;
(Bears) that they developed <i>his</i> name Areas, as in all such cases
of eponymous heroes.&nbsp; I slightly incline to hold that this is exactly
what occurred.&nbsp; A bear-kin claimed descent from a bear, and later,
developing an eponymous hero, Areas, regarded him as son of a bear.&nbsp;
Philologically &lsquo;it is possible;&rsquo; I say no more.</p>
<h3>The Bear Dance</h3>
<p>&lsquo;The dances of the maidens called &alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&iota;,
would receive an easy interpretation.&nbsp; They were Arkades, and why
not &alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&iota; (bears)?&rsquo;&nbsp; And
if &alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&iota;, why not clad in bear-skins,
and all the rest? (ii. 738).&nbsp; This is our author&rsquo;s explanation;
it is also my own conjecture.&nbsp; The Arcadians were bears, knew it,
and possibly danced a bear dance, as Mandans or Nootkas dance a buffalo
dance or a wolf dance.&nbsp; But all such dances are not totemistic.&nbsp;
They have often other aims.&nbsp; One only names such dances totemistic
when performed by people who call themselves by the name of the animal
represented, and claim descent from him.&nbsp; Our author says genially,
&lsquo;if anybody prefers to say that the <i>arctos</i> was something
like a totem of the Arcadians . . . why not?&rsquo;&nbsp; But, if the
<i>arctos</i> was a totem, that fact explains the Callisto story and
Attic bear dance, while the philological theory&mdash;Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
theory&mdash;does not explain it.&nbsp; What is oddest of all, Mr. Max
M&uuml;ller, as we have seen, says that the bear-dancing girls were
&lsquo;Arkades.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now we hear of no bear dances in Arcadia.&nbsp;
The dancers were <i>Athenian</i> girls.&nbsp; This, indeed, is the point.&nbsp;
We have a bear Callisto (Artemis) in Arcady, where a folk etymology
might explain it by stretching a point.&nbsp; But no etymology will
explain bear dances to Artemis in Attica.&nbsp; So we find bears doubly
connected with Artemis.&nbsp; The Athenians were not Arcadians.</p>
<p>As to the meaning and derivation of Artemis, or Artamis, our author
knows nothing (ii. 741).&nbsp; I say, &lsquo;even &Alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&epsilon;&mu;&iota;&sigmaf;
(&alpha;&rho;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;, bear) has occurred to inventive
men.&rsquo;&nbsp; Possibly I invented it myself, though not addicted
to etymological conjecture.</p>
<h2>THE FIRE-WALK</h2>
<h3>The Method of Psychical Research</h3>
<p>As a rule, mythology asks for no aid from Psychical Research.&nbsp;
But there are problems in religious rite and custom where the services
of the Cendrillon of the sciences, the despised youngest sister, may
be of use.&nbsp; As an example I take the famous mysterious old Fire-rite
of the Hirpi, or wolf-kin, of Mount Soracte.&nbsp; I shall first, following
Mannhardt, and making use of my own trifling researches in ancient literature,
describe the rite itself.</p>
<h3>Mount Soracte</h3>
<p>Everyone has heard of Mount Soracte, white with shining snow, the
peak whose distant cold gave zest to the blazing logs on the hearth
of Horace.&nbsp; Within sight of his windows was practised, by men calling
themselves &lsquo;wolves&rsquo; (<i>Hirpi</i>), a rite of extreme antiquity
and enigmatic character.&nbsp; On a peak of Soracte, now Monte di Silvestre,
stood the ancient temple of Soranus, a Sabine sun-god. <a name="citation148a"></a><a href="#footnote148a">{148a}</a>&nbsp;
Virgil <a name="citation148b"></a><a href="#footnote148b">{148b}</a>
identifies Soranus with Apollo.&nbsp; At the foot of the cliff was the
precinct of <i>Feronia</i>, a Sabine goddess.&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller
says that Feronia corresponds to the Vedic <i>Bhuranyu</i>, a name of
Agni, the Vedic fire-god (ii. 800).&nbsp; Mannhardt prefers, of course,
a derivation from <i>far</i> (grain), as in <i>confarreatio</i>, the
ancient Roman bride-cake form of marriage.&nbsp; <i>Feronia</i> <i>Mater=</i>Sanskrit
<i>bharsani</i> <i>mata</i>, <i>Getreide</i> <i>Mutter</i>. <a name="citation149a"></a><a href="#footnote149a">{149a}</a>&nbsp;
It is a pity that philologists so rarely agree in their etymologies.&nbsp;
In Greek the goddess is called <i>Anthephorus</i>, <i>Philostephanus</i>,
and even <i>Persephone</i>&mdash;probably the Persephone of flowers
and garlands. <a name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b">{149b}</a></p>
<h3>Hirpi Sorani</h3>
<p>Once a year a <i>f&ecirc;te</i> of Soranus and Feronia was held,
in the precinct of the goddess at Soracte.&nbsp; The ministrants were
members of certain local families called Hirpi (wolves).&nbsp; Pliny
says, <a name="citation149c"></a><a href="#footnote149c">{149c}</a>
&lsquo;A few families, styled Hirpi, at a yearly sacrifice, walk over
a burnt pile of wood, yet are not scorched.&nbsp; On this account they
have a perpetual exemption, by decree of the Senate, from military and
all other services.&rsquo;&nbsp; Virgil makes Aruns say, <a name="citation149d"></a><a href="#footnote149d">{149d}</a>
&lsquo;Highest of gods, Apollo, guardian of Soracte, thou of whom we
are the foremost worshippers, thou for whom the burning pile of pinewood
is fed, while we, strong in faith, walk through the midst of the fire,
and press our footsteps in the glowing mass. . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; Strabo
gives the same facts.&nbsp; Servius, the old commentator on Virgil,
confuses the Hirpi, not unnaturally, with the Sabine &lsquo;clan,&rsquo;
the Hirpini.&nbsp; He says, <a name="citation149e"></a><a href="#footnote149e">{149e}</a>
&lsquo;Varro, always an enemy of religious belief, writes that the Hirpini,
when about to walk the fire, smear the soles of their feet with a drug&rsquo;
(<i>medicamentum</i>).&nbsp; Silius Italicus (v. 175) speaks of the
ancient rite, when &lsquo;the holy bearer of the bow (Apollo) rejoices
in the kindled pyres, and the ministrant thrice gladly bears entrails
to the god through the harmless flames.&rsquo;&nbsp; Servius gives an
&aelig;tiological myth to account for the practice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wolves
came and carried off the entrails from the fire; shepherds, following
them, were killed by mortal vapours from a cave; thence ensued a pestilence,
because they had followed the wolves.&nbsp; An oracle bade them &ldquo;play
the wolf,&rdquo; <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. live on plunder, whence they were
called <i>Hirpi</i>, wolves,&rsquo; an attempt to account for a wolf
clan-name.&nbsp; There is also a story that, when the grave of Feronia
seemed all on fire, and the people were about carrying off the statue,
it suddenly grew green again. <a name="citation150a"></a><a href="#footnote150a">{150a}</a></p>
<p>Mannhardt decides that the so-called wolves leaped through the sun-god&rsquo;s
fire, in the interest of the health of the community.&nbsp; He elucidates
this by a singular French popular custom, held on St. John&rsquo;s Eve,
at Jumi&egrave;ges.&nbsp; The Brethren of the Green Wolf select a leader
called Green Wolf, there is an ecclesiastical procession, <i>cur&eacute;</i>
and all, a <i>souper</i> <i>maigre</i>, the lighting of the usual St.
John&rsquo;s fire, a dance round the fire, the capture of next year&rsquo;s
Green Wolf, a mimicry of throwing him into the fire, a revel, and next
day a loaf of <i>pain</i> <i>b&eacute;nit</i>, above a pile of green
leaves, is carried about. <a name="citation150b"></a><a href="#footnote150b">{150b}</a></p>
<p>The wolf, thinks Mannhardt, is the Vegetation-spirit in animal form.&nbsp;
Many examples of the &lsquo;Corn-wolf&rsquo; in popular custom are given
by Mr. Frazer in <i>The</i> <i>Golden</i> <i>Bough</i> (ii. 3-6).&nbsp;
The Hirpi of Soracte, then, are so called because they play the part
of Corn-wolves, or <i>Kornd&auml;monen</i> in wolf shape.&nbsp; But
Mannhardt adds, &lsquo;this <i>seems</i>, at least, to be the explanation.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He then combats Kuhn&rsquo;s theory of Feronia as lightning goddess.
<a name="citation151a"></a><a href="#footnote151a">{151a}</a>&nbsp;
He next compares the strange Arcadian cannibal rites on Mount Lyc&aelig;us.
<a name="citation151b"></a><a href="#footnote151b">{151b}</a></p>
<h3>Mannhardt&rsquo;s Deficiency</h3>
<p>In all this ingenious reasoning, Mannhardt misses a point.&nbsp;
What the Hirpi did was <i>not</i> merely to leap through light embers,
as in the Roman <i>Palilia</i>, and the parallel doings in Scotland,
England, France, and elsewhere, at Midsummer (St. John&rsquo;s Eve).&nbsp;
The Hirpi would not be freed from military service and all other State
imposts for merely doing what any set of peasants do yearly for nothing.&nbsp;
Nor would Varro have found it necessary to explain so easy and common
a feat by the use of a drug with which the feet were smeared.&nbsp;
Mannhardt, as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller says, ventured himself little &lsquo;among
red skins and black skins.&rsquo;&nbsp; He read Dr. Tylor, and appreciated
the method of illustrating ancient rites and beliefs from the living
ways of living savages. <a name="citation151c"></a><a href="#footnote151c">{151c}</a>&nbsp;
But, in practice, he mainly confined himself to illustrating ancient
rites and beliefs by survival in modern rural folk-lore.&nbsp; I therefore
supplement Mannhardt&rsquo;s evidence from European folk-lore by evidence
from savage life, and by a folk-lore case which Mannhardt did not know.</p>
<h3>The Fire-walk</h3>
<p>A modern student is struck by the cool way in which the ancient poets,
geographers, and commentators mention a startling circumstance, the
Fire-walk.&nbsp; The only hint of explanation is the statement that
the drug or juice of herbs preserved the Hirpi from harm.&nbsp; That
theory may be kept in mind, and applied if it is found useful.&nbsp;
Virgil&rsquo;s theory that the ministrants walk, <i>pietate</i> <i>freti</i>,
corresponds to Mrs. Wesley&rsquo;s belief, when, after praying, she
&lsquo;waded the flames&rsquo; to rescue her children from the burning
parsonage at Epworth.&nbsp; The hypothesis of Iamblichus, when he writes
about the ecstatic or &lsquo;possessed&rsquo; persons who cannot be
injured by fire, is like that of modern spiritualists&mdash;the &lsquo;spirit&rsquo;
or &lsquo;d&aelig;mon&rsquo; preserves them unharmed.</p>
<p>I intentionally omit cases which are vaguely analogous to that of
the Hirpi.&nbsp; In Icelandic sagas, in the <i>Relations</i> of the
old Jesuit missionaries, in the Travels of Pallas and Gmelin, we hear
of medicine-men and Berserks who take liberties with red-hot metal,
live coals, and burning wood.&nbsp; Thus in the Icelandic <i>Flatey</i>
<i>Book</i> (vol. i. p. 425) we read about the fighting evangelist of
Iceland, a story of Thangbrandr and the foreign Berserkir.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
Berserkir said: &ldquo;I can walk through the burning fire with my bare
feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then a great fire was made, which Thangbrandr hallowed,
and the Berserkir went into it without fear, and burned his feet&rsquo;&mdash;the
Christian spell of Thangbrandr being stronger than the heathen spell
of the Berserkir.&nbsp; What the saga says is not evidence, and some
of the other tales are merely traditional.&nbsp; Others may be explained,
perhaps, by conjuring.&nbsp; The medi&aelig;val ordeal by fire may also
be left on one side.&nbsp; In 1826 Lockhart published a translation
of the Church Service for the Ordeal by Fire, a document given, he says,
by B&uuml;sching in <i>Die</i> <i>Vorzeit</i> for 1817.&nbsp; The accused
communicates before carrying the red-hot iron bar, or walking on the
red-hot ploughshare.&nbsp; The consecrated wafer is supposed to preserve
him from injury, if he be guiltless.&nbsp; He carries the iron for nine
yards, after which his hands are sealed up in a linen cloth and examined
at the end of three days.&nbsp; &lsquo;If he be found clear of scorch
or scar, glory to God.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lockhart calls the service &lsquo;one
of the most extraordinary records of the craft, the audacity, and the
weakness of mankind.&rsquo; <a name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153">{153}</a></p>
<p>The fraud is more likely to have lain in the pretended failure to
find scorch or scar than in any method of substituting cold for hot
iron, or of preventing the metal from injuring the subject of the ordeal.&nbsp;
The rite did not long satisfy the theologians and jurists of the Middle
Ages.&nbsp; It has been discussed by Lingard in his <i>History</i> <i>of</i>
<i>England</i>, and by Dr. E. B. Tylor in <i>Primitive</i> <i>Culture</i>.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the present inquiry I also omit all the rites
of leaping sportfully, and of driving cattle through light fires.&nbsp;
Of these cases, from the Roman <i>Palilia</i>, or <i>Parilia</i>, downwards,
there is a useful collection in Brand&rsquo;s <i>Popular</i> <i>Antiquities</i>
under the heading &lsquo;Midsummer Eve.&rsquo;&nbsp; One exception must
be made for a passage from Torreblanca&rsquo;s <i>Demonologia</i> (p.
106).&nbsp; People are said &lsquo;pyras circumire et transilire in
futuri mali averruncatione&rsquo;&mdash;to &lsquo;go round about and
leap over lighted pyres for the purpose of averting future evils,&rsquo;
as in Mannhardt&rsquo;s theory of the Hirpi.&nbsp; This may be connected
with the Bulgarian rite, to be described later, but, as a rule, in all
these instances, the fire is a light one of straw, and no sort of immunity
is claimed by the people who do not walk through, but leap across it.</p>
<p>These kinds of analogous examples, then, it suffices merely to mention.&nbsp;
For the others, in all affairs of this sort, the wide diffusion of a
tale of miracle is easily explained.&nbsp; The fancy craves for miracles,
and the universal mode of inventing a miracle is to deny the working,
on a given occasion, of a law of Nature.&nbsp; Gravitation was suspended,
men floated in air, inanimate bodies became agile, or fire did not burn.&nbsp;
No less natural than the invention of the myth is the attempt to feign
it by conjuring or by the use of some natural secret.&nbsp; But in the
following modern instances the miracle of passing through the fire uninjured
is apparently feigned with considerable skill, or is performed by the
aid of some secret of Nature not known to modern chemistry.&nbsp; The
evidence is decidedly good enough to prove that in Europe, India, and
Polynesia the ancient rite of the Hirpi of Soracte is still a part of
religious or customary ceremony.</p>
<h3>Fijian Fire-walk</h3>
<p>The case which originally drew my attention to this topic is that
given by Mr. Basil Thomson in his <i>South</i> <i>Sea</i> <i>Yarns</i>
(p. 195).&nbsp; Mr. Thomson informs me that he wrote his description
on the day after he witnessed the ceremony, a precaution which left
no room for illusions of memory.&nbsp; Of course, in describing a conjuring
trick, one who is not an expert records, not what actually occurred,
but what he was able to see, and the chances are that he did not see,
and therefore omits, an essential circumstance, while he misstates other
circumstances.&nbsp; I am informed by Mrs. Steel, the author of <i>The</i>
<i>Potter&rsquo;s</i> <i>Thumb</i> and other stories of Indian life,
that, in watching an Indian conjurer, she generally, or frequently,
detects his method.&nbsp; She says that the conjurer often begins by
whirling rapidly before the eyes of the spectators a small polished
skull of a monkey, and she is inclined to think that the spectators
who look at this are, in some way, more easily deluded.&nbsp; These
facts are mentioned that I may not seem unaware of what can be said
to impugn the accuracy of the descriptions of the Fire Rite, as given
by Mr. Thomson and other witnesses.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson says that the Wesleyan missionaries have nearly made
a clean sweep of all heathen ceremonial in Fiji.&nbsp; &lsquo;But in
one corner of Fiji, the island of Nbengga, a curious observance of mythological
origin has escaped the general destruction, probably because the worthy
iconoclasts had never heard of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The myth tells how the
ancestor of the clan received the gift of fire-walking from a god, and
the existence of the myth raises a presumption in favour of the antiquity
of the observance.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once every year the <i>mas&aacute;we</i>, a drac&aelig;na
that grows in profusion on the grassy hillsides of the island, becomes
fit to yield the sugar of which its fibrous root is full.&nbsp; To render
it fit to eat, the roots must be baked among hot stones for four days.&nbsp;
A great pit is dug, and filled with large stones and blazing logs, and
when these have burned down, and the stones are at white heat, the oven
is ready for the <i>mas&aacute;we</i>.&nbsp; It is at this stage that
the clan Na Ivilankata, favoured of the gods, is called on to &ldquo;leap
into the oven&rdquo; (<i>rikata</i> <i>na</i> <i>lovo</i>), and walk
unharmed upon the hot stones that would scorch and wither the feet of
any but the descendants of the dauntless Tui Nkualita.&nbsp; Twice only
had Europeans been fortunate enough to see the <i>mas&aacute;we</i>
cooked, and so marvellous had been the tales they told, and so cynical
the scepticism with which they had been received, that nothing short
of another performance before witnesses and the photographic camera
would have satisfied the average &ldquo;old hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As we steamed up to the chiefs village of Waisoma, a cloud
of blue smoke rolling up among the palms told us that the fire was newly
lighted.&nbsp; We found a shallow pit, nineteen feet wide, dug in the
sandy soil, a stone&rsquo;s throw from high-water mark, in a small clearing
among the cocoanuts between the beach and the dense forest.&nbsp; The
pit was piled high with great blazing logs and round stones the size
of a man&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Mingled with the crackling roar of the
fire were loud reports as splinters flew off from the stones, warning
us to guard our eyes.&nbsp; A number of men were dragging up more logs
and rolling them into the blaze, while, above all, on the very brink
of the fiery pit, stood Jonathan Dambea, directing the proceedings with
an air of noble calm.&nbsp; As the stones would not be hot enough for
four hours, there was ample time to hear the tradition that warrants
the observance of the strange ceremony we were to see.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we were at last summoned, the fire had been burning for
more than four hours.&nbsp; The pit was filled with a white-hot mass
shooting out little tongues of white flame, and throwing out a heat
beside which the scorching sun was a pleasant relief.&nbsp; A number
of men were engaged, with long poles to which a loop of thick vine had
been attached, in noosing the pieces of unburnt wood by twisting the
pole, like a horse&rsquo;s twitch, until the loop was tight, and dragging
the log out by main force.&nbsp; When the wood was all out there remained
a conical pile of glowing stones in the middle of the pit.&nbsp; Ten
men now drove the butts of green saplings into the base of the pile,
and held the upper end while a stout vine was passed behind the row
of saplings.&nbsp; A dozen men grasped each end of the vine, and with
loud shouts hauled with all their might.&nbsp; The saplings, like the
teeth of an enormous rake, tore through the pile of stones, flattening
them out towards the opposite edge of the pit.&nbsp; The saplings were
then driven in on the other side and the stones raked in the opposite
direction, then sideways, until the bottom of the pit was covered with
an even layer of hot stones.&nbsp; This process had taken fully half
an hour, but any doubt as to the heat of the stones at the end was set
at rest by the tongues of flame that played continually among them.&nbsp;
The cameras were hard at work, and a large crowd of people pressed inwards
towards the pit as the moment drew near.&nbsp; They were all excited
except Jonathan, who preserved, even in the supreme moment, the air
of holy calm that never leaves his face.&nbsp; All eyes are fixed expectant
on the dense bush behind the clearing, whence the Shadrachs, Meshachs
and Abednegos of the Pacific are to emerge.&nbsp; There is a cry of
&ldquo;<i>Vutu</i>!&nbsp; <i>Vutu</i>!&rdquo; and forth from the bush,
two and two, march fifteen men, dressed in garlands and fringes.&nbsp;
They tramp straight to the brink of the pit.&nbsp; The leading pair
show something like fear in their faces, but do not pause, perhaps because
the rest would force them to move forward.&nbsp; They step down upon
the stones and continue their march round the pit, planting their feet
squarely and firmly on each stone.&nbsp; The cameras snap, the crowd
surges forward, the bystanders fling in great bundles of green leaves.&nbsp;
But the bundles strike the last man of the procession and cut him off
from his fellows; so he stays where he is, trampling down the leaves
as they are thrown to line the pit, in a dense cloud of steam from the
boiling sap.&nbsp; The rest leap back to his assistance, shouting and
trampling, and the pit turns into the mouth of an Inferno, filled with
dusky frenzied fiends, half seen through the dense volume that rolls
up to heaven and darkens the sunlight.&nbsp; After the leaves, palm-leaf
baskets of the drac&aelig;na root are flung to them, more leaves, and
then bystanders and every one join in shovelling earth over all till
the pit is gone, and a smoking mound of fresh earth takes its place.&nbsp;
This will keep hot for four days, and then the <i>mas&aacute;we</i>
will be cooked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As the procession had filed up to the pit, by a preconcerted
arrangement with the noble Jonathan, a large stone had been hooked out
of the pit to the feet of one of the party, who poised a pocket-handkerchief
over it, and dropped it lightly upon the stone when the first man leapt
into the oven, and snatched what remained of it up as the last left
the stones.&nbsp; During the fifteen or twenty seconds it lay there
every fold that touched the stone was charred, and the rest of it scorched
yellow.&nbsp; So the stones were not cool.&nbsp; We caught four or five
of the performers as they came out, and closely examined their feet.&nbsp;
They were cool, and showed no trace of scorching, nor were their anklets
of dried tree-fern leaf burnt.&nbsp; This, Jonathan explained, is part
of the miracle; for dried tree-fern is as combustible as tinder, and
there were flames shooting out among the stones.&nbsp; Sceptics had
affirmed that the skin of a Fijian&rsquo;s foot being a quarter of an
inch thick, he would not feel a burn.&nbsp; Whether this be true or
not of the ball and heel, the instep is covered with skin no thicker
than our own, and we saw the men plant their insteps fairly on the stone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson&rsquo;s friend, Jonathan, said that young men had been
selected because they would look better in a photograph, and, being
inexperienced, they were afraid.&nbsp; A stranger would share the gift
if he went in with one of the tribe.&nbsp; Some years ago a man fell
and burned his shoulders.&nbsp; &lsquo;Any trick?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Here
Jonathan&rsquo;s ample face shrunk smaller, and a shadow passed over
his candid eye.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Thomson concludes: &lsquo;Perhaps the
Na Ivilankata clan have no secret, and there is nothing wonderful in
their performance; but, miracle or not, I am very glad I saw it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The handkerchief dropped on the stone is &lsquo;alive to testify to
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Thomson&rsquo;s photograph of the scene is ill-developed,
and the fumes of steam somewhat interfere with the effect.&nbsp; A rough
copy is published in <i>Folk</i>-<i>Lore</i> for September, 1895, but
the piece could only be reproduced by a delicate drawing with the brush.</p>
<p>The parallel to the rite of the Hirpi is complete, except that red-hot
stones, not the pyre of pine-embers, is used in Fiji.&nbsp; Mr. Thomson
has heard of a similar ceremony in the Cook group of islands.&nbsp;
As in ancient Italy, so in Fiji, a certain <i>clan</i> have the privilege
of fire-walking.&nbsp; It is far enough from Fiji to Southern India,
as it is far enough from Mount Soracte to Fiji.&nbsp; But in Southern
India the Klings practise the rite of the Hirpi and the Na Ivilankata.&nbsp;
I give my informant&rsquo;s letter exactly as it reached me, though
it has been published before in <i>Longman&rsquo;s</i> <i>Magazine</i>:</p>
<h3>Kling Fire-walk</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;Observing from your note in <i>Longman&rsquo;s</i>
<i>Magazine</i> that you have mislaid my notes <i>re</i> fire-walking,
I herewith repeat them.&nbsp; I have more than once seen it done by
the &ldquo;Klings,&rdquo; as the low-caste Tamil-speaking Hindus from
Malabar are called, in the Straits Settlements.&nbsp; On one occasion
I was present at a &ldquo;fire-walking&rdquo; held in a large tapioca
plantation in Province Wellesley, before many hundreds of spectators,
all the Hindu coolies from the surrounding estates being mustered.&nbsp;
A trench had been dug about twenty yards long by six feet wide and two
deep.&nbsp; This was piled with faggots and small wood four or five
feet high.&nbsp; This was lighted at midday, and by four p.m. the trench
was a bed of red-hot ashes, the heat from which was so intense that
the men who raked and levelled it with long poles could not stand it
for more than a minute at a time.&nbsp; A few yards from the end of
the trench a large hole had been dug and filled with water.&nbsp; When
all was ready, six men, ordinary coolies, dressed only in their &ldquo;dholis,&rdquo;
or loin-cloths, stepped out of the crowd, and, amidst tremendous excitement
and a horrible noise of conches and drums, passed over the burning trench
from end to end, in single file, at a quick walk, plunging one after
the other into the water.&nbsp; Not one of them showed the least sign
of injury.&nbsp; They had undergone some course of preparation by their
priest, not a Brahman, but some kind of devil-doctor or medicine-man,
and, as I understood it, they took on themselves and expiated the sins
of the Kling community for the past year (a big job, if thieving and
lying count; probably not).&nbsp; They are not, however, always so lucky,
for I heard that on the next occasion one of the men fell and was terribly
burnt, thus destroying the whole effect of the ceremony.&nbsp; I do
not think this to be any part of the Brahmanical religion, though the
ordeal by fire as a test of guilt is, or was, in use all over India.&nbsp;
The fact is that the races of Southern India, where the Aryan element
is very small, have kept all their savage customs and devil-worship
under the form of Brahmanism.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Another curious feat I saw performed at Labuan Deli, in Sumatra,
on the Chinese New Year.&nbsp; A Chinaman of the coolie class was squatted
stark naked on the roadside, holding on his knees a brass pan the size
of a wash-hand basin, piled a foot high with red-hot charcoal.&nbsp;
The heat reached one&rsquo;s face at two yards, but if it had been a
tray of ices the man couldn&rsquo;t have been more unconcerned.&nbsp;
There was a crowd of Chinese round him, all eagerly asking questions,
and a pile of coppers accumulating beside him.&nbsp; A Chinese shopkeeper
told me that the man &ldquo;told fortunes,&rdquo; but from the circumstance
of a gambling-house being close by, I concluded that his customers were
getting tips on a system.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hoping these notes may be of service to you,<br />
&lsquo;I remain,<br />
&lsquo;Yours truly,<br />
&lsquo;STEPHEN PONDER.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In this rite the fire-pit is thrice as long (at a rough estimate)
as that of the Fijians.&nbsp; The fire is of wooden embers, not heated
stones.&nbsp; As in Fiji, a man who falls is burned, clearly suggesting
that the feet and legs, <i>but</i> <i>not</i> <i>the</i> <i>whole</i>
<i>body</i>, are in some way prepared to resist the fire.&nbsp; As we
shall find to be the practice in Bulgaria, the celebrants place their
feet afterwards in water.&nbsp; As in Bulgaria, drums are beaten to
stimulate the fire-walkers.&nbsp; Neither here nor in Fiji are the performers
said to be entranced, like the Bulgarian <i>Nistinares</i>. <a name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161">{161}</a>&nbsp;
On the whole, the Kling rite (which the Klings, I am informed, also
practise in the islands whither they are carried as coolies) so closely
resembles the Fijian and the Tongan that one would explain the likeness
by transmission, were the ceremony not almost as like the rite of the
Hirpi.&nbsp; For the Tongan fire-ritual, the source is <i>The</i> <i>Polynesian</i>
<i>Society&rsquo;s</i> <i>Journal</i>, vol. ii.&nbsp; No. 2. pp. 105-108.&nbsp;
My attention was drawn to this by Mr. Laing, writing from New Zealand.&nbsp;
The article is by Miss Tenira Henry, of Honolulu, a young lady of the
island.&nbsp; The Council of the Society, not having seen the rite,
&lsquo;do not guarantee the truth of the story, but willingly publish
it for the sake of the incantation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Miss Henry begins with
a description of the <i>ti</i>-plant (<i>Drac&aelig;na</i> <i>terminalis</i>),
which &lsquo;requires to be well baked before being eaten.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She proceeds thus:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i>ti</i>-ovens are frequently thirty feet in diameter,
and the large stones, heaped upon small logs of wood, take about twenty-four
hours to get properly heated.&nbsp; Then they are flattened down, by
means of long green poles, and the trunks of a few banana-trees are
stripped up and strewn over them to cause steam.&nbsp; The <i>ti</i>-roots
are then thrown in whole, accompanied by short pieces of <i>ap&eacute;</i>-<i>root</i>
(<i>Arum</i> <i>costatum</i>), that are not quite so thick as the <i>ti</i>,
but grow to the length of six feet and more.&nbsp; The oven is then
covered over with large leaves and soil, and left so for about three
days, when the <i>ti</i> and the <i>ap&eacute;</i> are taken out well
cooked, and of a rich, light-brown colour.&nbsp; The <i>ap&eacute;</i>
prevents the <i>ti</i> from getting too dry in the oven.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a strange ceremony connected with the Uum Ti (or
<i>ti</i>-oven), that used to be practised by the heathen priests at
Raiatea, but can now be performed by only two individuals (Tupua and
Taero), both descendants of priests.&nbsp; This ceremony consisted in
causing people to walk in procession through the hot oven when flattened
down, before anything had been placed in it, and without any preparation
whatever, bare-footed or shod, and on their emergence not even smelling
of fire.&nbsp; The manner of doing this was told by Tupua, who heads
the procession in the picture, to Monsieur Morn&eacute;, Lieutenant
de Vaisseau, who also took the photograph <a name="citation163"></a><a href="#footnote163">{163}</a>
of it, about two years ago, at Uturoa, Raiatea, which, being on bad
paper, was copied off by Mr. Barnfield, of Honolulu.&nbsp; All the white
residents of the place, as well as the French officers, were present
to see the ceremony, which is rarely performed nowadays.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No one has yet been able to solve the mystery of this surprising
feat, but it is to be hoped that scientists will endeavour to do so
while those men who practise it still live.</p>
<h3>Tupua&rsquo;s Incantation used in Walking Over the Uum-Ti.&mdash;Translation</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Hold the leaves of the <i>ti</i>-plant before picking them,
and say: &ldquo;O hosts of gods! awake, arise!&nbsp; You and I are going
to the <i>ti</i>-oven to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they float in the air, they are gods, but if their feet
touch the ground they are human beings.&nbsp; Then break the <i>ti</i>-leaves
off and look towards the direction of the oven, and say: &ldquo;O hosts
of gods! go to-night, and to-morrow you and I shall go.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then wrap the <i>ti</i>-leaves up in <i>han</i> (<i>Hibiscus</i>) leaves,
and put them to sleep in the <i>marae</i>, where they must remain until
morning, and say in leaving:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Arise! awake!&nbsp; O hosts of gods!&nbsp; Let your
feet take you to the <i>ti</i>-oven; fresh water and salt water come
also.&nbsp; Let the dark earth-worm and the light earth-worm go to the
oven.&nbsp; Let the redness and the shades of fire all go.&nbsp; You
will go; you will go to-night, and to-morrow it will be you and I; we
shall go to the Uum-Ti.&rdquo;&nbsp; (This is for the night.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;When the <i>ti</i>-leaves are brought away, they must be tied
up in a wand and carried straight to the oven, and opened when all are
ready to pass through; then hold the wand forward and say:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;O men (spirits) who heated the oven! let it die out!&nbsp;
O dark earth-worms!&nbsp; O light earthworms! fresh water and salt water,
heat of the oven and redness of the oven, hold up the footsteps of the
walkers, and fan the heat of the bed.&nbsp; O cold beings, let us lie
in the midst of the oven!&nbsp; O Great-Woman-who-set-fire-to-the-skies!
hold the fan, and let us go into the oven for a little while!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then, when all are ready to walk in, we say:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Holder of the first footstep!<br />
Holder of the second footstep!<br />
Holder of the third footstep!<br />
Holder of the fourth footstep!<br />
Holder of the fifth footstep!<br />
Holder of the sixth footstep!<br />
Holder of the seventh footstep!<br />
Holder of the eighth footstep!<br />
Holder of the ninth footstep!<br />
Holder of the tenth footstep!<br />
&ldquo;O Great-Woman-who-set-fire-to-the-skies! all is covered!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Then everybody walks through without hurt, into the middle
and around the oven, following the leader, with the wand beating from
side to side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Great-Woman-who-set-fire-to-the-skies was a high-born
woman in olden times, who made herself respected by the oppressive men
when they placed women under so many restrictions.&nbsp; She is said
to have had the lightning at her command, and struck men with it when
they encroached on her rights.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All the above is expressed in old Tahitian, and when quickly
spoken is not easily understood by the modern listener.&nbsp; Many of
the words, though found in the dictionary, are now obsolete, and the
arrangement of others is changed.&nbsp; <i>Oe</i> and <i>tana</i> are
never used now in place of the plural <i>outou</i> and <i>tatou</i>;
but in old folk-lore it is the classical style of addressing the gods
in the collective sense.&nbsp; <i>Tahutahu</i> means sorcery, and also
to kindle a fire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So far Miss Henry, on this occasion, and the archaic nature of the
hymn, with the reference to a mythical leader of the revolt of women,
deserves the attention of anthropologists, apart from the singular character
of the rite described.&nbsp; In the third number of the <i>Journal</i>
(vol. ii.) the following editorial note is published:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Miss Tenira Henry authorises us to say that her
sister and her sister&rsquo;s little child were some of those who joined
in the Uum-Ti ceremony referred to in vol. ii. p. 108, and in the preceding
note, and actually walked over the red-hot stones.&nbsp; The illustration
of the performance given in the last number of the <i>Journal</i>, it
appears, is actually from a photograph taken by Lieutenant Morn&eacute;,
the original of which Miss Henry has sent us for inspection.&mdash;EDITOR.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Corroborative Evidence</h3>
<p>The following corroborative account is given in the <i>Journal</i>,
from a source vaguely described as &lsquo;a pamphlet published in San
Francisco, by Mr. Hastwell:&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The natives of Raiatea have some performances so entirely
out of the ordinary course of events as to institute (<i>sic</i>) inquiry
relative to a proper solution.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On September 20, 1885, I witnessed the wonderful, and to me
inexplicable, performance of passing through the &ldquo;fiery furnace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The furnace that I saw was an excavation of three or four
feet in the ground, in a circular form (sloping upwards), and about
thirty feet across.&nbsp; The excavation was filled with logs and wood,
and then covered with large stones.&nbsp; A fire was built underneath,
and kept burning for a day.&nbsp; When I witnessed it, on the second
day, the flames were pouring up through the interstices of the rocks,
which were heated to a red and white heat.&nbsp; When everything was
in readiness, and the furnace still pouring out its intense heat, the
natives marched up with bare feet to the edge of the furnace, where
they halted for a moment, and after a few passes of the wand made of
the branches of the <i>ti</i>-plant by the leader, who repeated a few
words in the native language, they stepped down on the rocks and walked
leisurely across to the other side, stepping from stone to stone.&nbsp;
This was repeated five times, without any preparation whatever on their
feet, and without injury or discomfort from the heated stones.&nbsp;
There was not even the smell of fire on their garments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Mr. N. J. Tone, in the same periodical (ii. 3,193), says that he
arrived just too late to see the same rite at Bukit Mestajam, in Province
Wellesley, Straits Settlements; he did see the pit and the fire, and
examined the naked feet, quite uninjured, of the performers.&nbsp; He
publishes an extract to this effect from his diary.&nbsp; The performers,
I believe, were Klings.&nbsp; Nothing is said to indicate any condition
of trance, or other abnormal state, in the fire-walkers.</p>
<h3>The Fire-walk in Trinidad.</h3>
<p>Mr. Henry E. St. Clair, writing on September 14. 1896, says: &lsquo;In
Trinidad, British West Indies, the rite is performed annually about
this time of the year among the Indian coolie immigrants resident in
the small village of Peru, a mile or so from Port of Spain.&nbsp; I
have personally witnessed the passing, and the description given by
Mr. Ponder tallies with what I saw, except that, so far as I can remember,
the number of those who took part in the rite was greater than six.&nbsp;
In addition, there is this circumstance, which was not mentioned by
that gentleman: each of the &ldquo;passers&rdquo; carried one or two
lemons, which they dropped into the fire as they went along.&nbsp; These
lemons were afterwards eagerly scrambled for by the bystanders, who,
so far as I can recollect, attributed a healing influence to them.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Fire-walk</h3>
<p>As to the Bulgarian rite, Dr. Schischmanof writes to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I am sure the observance will surprise you; I
am even afraid that you will think it rather fantastic, but you may
rely on my information.&nbsp; The <i>danse</i> <i>de</i> <i>feu</i>
was described long ago in a Bulgarian periodical by one of our best
known writers.&nbsp; What you are about to read only confirms his account.&nbsp;
What I send you is from the <i>Recueil</i> <i>de</i> <i>Folk</i> <i>Lore</i>,
<i>de</i> <i>Litt&eacute;rature</i> <i>et</i> <i>de</i> <i>Science</i>
(vol. vi. p. 224), edited, with my aid and that of my colleague, Mastov,
by the Minister of Public Instruction.&nbsp; How will you explain these
<i>hauts</i> <i>faits</i> <i>de</i> <i>l&rsquo;extase</i> <i>religieuse</i>?&nbsp;
I cannot imagine!&nbsp; For my part, I think of the self-mutilations
and tortures of Dervishes and Fakirs, and wonder if we have not here
something analogous.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article in the Bulgarian serial is called &lsquo;The Nistinares.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The word is not Bulgarian; possibly it is Romaic.</p>
<p>The scene is in certain villages in Turkey, on the Bulgarian frontier,
and not far from the town of Bourgas, on the Euxine, in the department
of Lozen Grad.&nbsp; The ministrants (<i>Nistinares</i>) have the gift
of fire-walking as a hereditary talent; they are specially <i>just</i>,
and the gift is attributed as to a god in Fiji, in Bulgaria to St. Constantine
and St. Helena.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;These <i>just</i> <i>ones</i> feel a desire to
dance in the flames during the month of May; they are filled at the
same time with some unknown force, which enables them to predict the
future.&nbsp; The best <i>Nistinare</i> is he who can dance longest
in the live flame, and utter the most truthful prophecies.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Nistinares</i> may be of either sex.</p>
<p>On May 1 the <i>Nistinares</i> hold a kind of religious festival
at the house of one of their number.&nbsp; Salutations are exchanged,
and presents of food and <i>raki</i> are made to the chief <i>Nistinare</i>.&nbsp;
The holy <i>icones</i> of saints are wreathed with flowers, and perfumed
with incense.&nbsp; Arrangements are made for purifying the holy wells
and springs.</p>
<p>On May 21, the day of St. Helena and St. Constantine, the parish
priest says Mass in the grey of dawn.&nbsp; At sunrise all the village
meets in festal array; the youngest <i>Nistinare</i> brings from the
church the <i>icones</i> of the two saints, and drums are carried behind
them in procession.&nbsp; They reach the sacred well in the wood, which
the priest blesses.&nbsp; This is parallel to the priestly benediction
on &lsquo;Fountain Sunday&rsquo; of the well beneath the Fairy Tree
at Domremy, where Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc was accused of meeting the Good
Ladies. <a name="citation169"></a><a href="#footnote169">{169}</a>&nbsp;
Everyone drinks of the water, and there is a sacrifice of rams, ewes,
and oxen.&nbsp; A festival follows, as was the use of Domremy in the
days of the Maid; then all return to the village.&nbsp; The holy drum,
which hangs all the year before St. Helena in the church, is played
upon.&nbsp; A mock combat between the <i>icones</i> which have visited
the various holy wells is held.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in each village, pyres of dry wood, amounting to thirty,
fifty, or even a hundred cartloads, have been piled up.&nbsp; The wood
is set on fire before the procession goes forth to the hallowing of
the fountains.&nbsp; On returning, the crowd dances a <i>horo</i> (round
dance) about the glowing logs.&nbsp; Heaps of embers (<i>Pineus</i>
<i>acervus</i>) are made, and water is thrown on the ground.&nbsp; The
musicians play the tune called &lsquo;L&rsquo;Air Nistinar.&rsquo;&nbsp;
A <i>Nistinare</i> breaks through the dance, <i>turns</i> <i>blue</i>,
trembles like a leaf, and glares wildly with his eyes.&nbsp; The dance
ends, and everybody goes to the best point of view.&nbsp; Then the wildest
<i>Nistinare</i> seizes the <i>icon</i>, turns it to the crowd, and
with naked feet climbs the pyre of glowing embers.&nbsp; The music plays,
and the <i>Nistinare</i> dances to the tune in the fire.&nbsp; If he
is so disposed he utters prophecies.&nbsp; He dances till his face resumes
its ordinary expression; then he begins to feel the burning; he leaves
the pyre, and places his feet in the mud made by the libations of water
already described.&nbsp; The second <i>Nistinare</i> then dances in
the fire, and so on.&nbsp; The predictions apply to villages and persons;
sometimes sinners are denounced, or repairs of the church are demanded
in this queer parish council.&nbsp; All through the month of May the
<i>Nistinares</i> call out for fire when they hear the <i>Nistinare</i>
music playing.&nbsp; They are very temperate men and women.&nbsp; Except
in May they do not clamour for fire, and cannot dance in it.</p>
<p>In this remarkable case the alleged gift is hereditary, is of saintly
origin, and is only exercised when the <i>Nistinare</i> is excited,
and (apparently) entranced by music and the dance, as is the manner
also of medicine-men among savages.&nbsp; The rite, with its sacrifices
of sheep and oxen, is manifestly of heathen origin.&nbsp; They &lsquo;pass
through the fire&rsquo; to St. Constantine, but the observance must
be far older than Bulgarian Christianity.&nbsp; The report says nothing
as to the state of the feet of the <i>Nistinares</i> after the fire-dance.&nbsp;
Medical inspection is desirable, and the photographic camera should
be used to catch a picture of the wild scene.&nbsp; My account is abridged
from the French version of the Bulgarian report sent by Dr. Schischmanof.</p>
<h3>Indian Fire-walk</h3>
<p>Since these lines were written the kindness of Mr. Tawney, librarian
at the India Office, has added to my stock of examples.&nbsp; Thus,
Mr. Stokes printed in the <i>Indian</i> <i>Antiquary</i> (ii. p. 190)
notes of evidence taken at an inquest on a boy of fourteen, who fell
during the fire-walk, was burned, and died on that day.&nbsp; The rite
had been forbidden, but was secretly practised in the village of Periy&acirc;ngridi.&nbsp;
The fire-pit was 27 feet long by 7&frac12; feet broad and a span in
depth.&nbsp; Thirteen persons walked through the hot wood embers, which,
in Mr. Stokes&rsquo;s opinion (who did not see the performance), &lsquo;would
hardly injure the tough skin of the sole of a labourer&rsquo;s foot,&rsquo;
yet killed a boy.&nbsp; The treading was usually done by men under vows,
perhaps vows made during illness.&nbsp; One, at least, walked &lsquo;because
it is my duty as P&ucirc;j&acirc;ri.&rsquo;&nbsp; Another says, &lsquo;I
got down into the fire at the east end, meditating on Draupat&icirc;,
walked through to the west, and up the bank.&rsquo;&nbsp; Draupat&icirc;
is a goddess, wife of the P&acirc;ndavas.&nbsp; Mr. Stokes reports that,
according to the incredulous, experienced fire-walkers smear their feet
with oil of the green frog.&nbsp; No report is made as to the condition
of their feet when they emerge from the fire.</p>
<p>Another case occurs in Oppert&rsquo;s work, <i>The</i> <i>Original</i>
<i>Inhabitants</i> <i>of</i> <i>India</i> (p. 480).&nbsp; As usual,
a pit is dug, filled with faggots.&nbsp; When these have burned down
&lsquo;a little,&rsquo; and &lsquo;while the heat is still unbearable
in the neighbourhood of the ditch, those persons who have made the vow
. . . walk . . . on the embers in the pit, without doing themselves
as a rule much harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again, in a case where butter is poured over the embers to make a
blaze, &lsquo;one of the tribal priests, in a state of religious afflatus,
walks through the fire.&nbsp; It is said that the sacred fire is harmless,
but some admit that a certain preservative ointment is used by the performers.&rsquo;&nbsp;
A chant used at Mirzapur (as in Fiji) is cited. <a name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171">{171}</a></p>
<p>In these examples the statements are rather vague.&nbsp; No evidence
is adduced as to the actual effect of the fire on the feet of the ministrants.&nbsp;
We hear casually of ointments which protect the feet, and of the thickness
of the skins of the fire-walkers, and of the unapproachable heat, but
we have nothing exact, no trace of scientific precision.&nbsp; The Government
&lsquo;puts down,&rsquo; but does not really investigate the rite.</p>
<h3>Psychical Parallels</h3>
<p>I now very briefly, and &lsquo;under all reserves,&rsquo; allude
to the only modern parallel in our country with which I am acquainted.&nbsp;
We have seen that Iamblichus includes insensibility to fire among the
privileges of Gr&aelig;co-Egyptian &lsquo;mediums.&rsquo; <a name="citation172"></a><a href="#footnote172">{172}</a>&nbsp;
The same gift was claimed by Daniel Dunglas Home, the notorious American
spiritualist.&nbsp; I am well aware that as Eusapia Paladino was detected
in giving a false impression that her hands were held by her neighbours
in the dark, therefore, when Mr. Crookes asserts that he saw Home handle
fire in the light, his testimony on this point can have no weight with
a logical public.&nbsp; Consequently it is not as evidence to the <i>fact</i>
that I cite Mr. Crookes, but for another purpose.&nbsp; Mr. Crookes&rsquo;s
remarks I heard, and I can produce plenty of living witnesses to the
same experiences with <i>D</i>. <i>D</i>. <i>Home</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I several times saw the fire test, both at my
own and at other houses.&nbsp; On one occasion he called me to him when
he went to the fire, and told me to watch carefully.&nbsp; He certainly
put his hand in the grate and handled the red-hot coals in a manner
which would have been impossible for me to have imitated without being
severely burnt.&nbsp; I once saw him go to a bright wood fire, and,
taking a large piece of red-hot charcoal, put it in the hollow of one
hand, and, covering it with the other, blow into the extempore furnace
till the coal was white hot, and the flames licked round his fingers.&nbsp;
No sign of burning could be seen then or afterwards on his hands.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On these occasions Home was, or was understood to be, &lsquo;entranced,&rsquo;
like the Bulgarian Nistinares.&nbsp; Among other phenomena, the white
handkerchief on which Home laid a red-hot coal was not scorched, nor,
on analysis, did it show any signs of chemical preparation.&nbsp; Home
could also (like the Fijians) communicate his alleged immunity to others
present; for example, to Mr. S. C. Hall.&nbsp; But it burned and marked
a man I know.&nbsp; Home, entranced, and handling a red-hot coal, passed
it to a gentleman of my acquaintance, whose hand still bears the scar
of the scorching endured in 1867.&nbsp; Immunity was not <i>always</i>
secured by experimenters.</p>
<p>I only mention these circumstances because Mr. Crookes has stated
that he knows no chemical preparation which would avert the ordinary
action of heat.&nbsp; Mr. Clodd (on the authority of Sir B. W. Richardson)
has suggested diluted sulphuric acid (so familiar to Klings, Hirpi,
Tongans, and Fijians).&nbsp; But Mr. Clodd produced no examples of successful
or unsuccessful experiment. <a name="citation173"></a><a href="#footnote173">{173}</a>&nbsp;
The nescience of Mr. Crookes may be taken to cover these valuable properties
of diluted sulphuric acid, unless Mr. Clodd succeeds in an experiment
which, if made on his own person, I would very willingly witness.</p>
<p>Merely for completeness, I mention Dr. Dozous&rsquo;s statement,
<a name="citation174"></a><a href="#footnote174">{174}</a> that he timed
by his watch Bernadette, the seer of Lourdes, while, for fifteen minutes,
she, in an ecstatic condition, held her hands in the flame of a candle.&nbsp;
He then examined her hands, which were not scorched or in any way affected
by the fire.&nbsp; This is called, at Lourdes, the <i>Miracle</i> <i>du</i>
<i>Cierge</i>.</p>
<p>Here ends my list of examples, in modern and ancient times, of a
rite which deserves, though it probably will not receive, the attention
of science.&nbsp; The widely diffused religious character of the performance
will, perhaps, be admitted as demonstrated.&nbsp; As to the method by
which the results are attained, whether by a chemical preparation, or
by the influence of a certain mental condition, or by thickness of skin,
or whether all the witnesses fable with a singular unanimity (shared
by photographic cameras), I am unable even to guess.&nbsp; On May 21,
in Bulgaria, a scientific observer might come to a conclusion.&nbsp;
At present I think it possible that the Jewish &lsquo;Passing through
the Fire&rsquo; may have been a harmless rite.</p>
<h3>Conclusion as to Fire-walk</h3>
<p>In all these cases, and others as to which I have first-hand evidence,
there are decided parallels to the Rite of the Hirpi, and to Biblical
and ecclesiastical miracles.&nbsp; The savage examples are <i>rites</i>,
and appear intended to secure good results in food supplies (Fiji),
or general well-being, perhaps by expiation for sins, as in the Attic
Thargelia.&nbsp; The Bulgarian rite also aims at propitiating general
good luck.</p>
<h3>Psychical Research</h3>
<p>But how is the Fire-walk done?&nbsp; That remains a mystery, and
perhaps no philologist, folk-lorist, anthropologist, or physiologist,
has seriously asked the question.&nbsp; The <i>medicamentum</i> of Varro,
the green frog fat of India, the diluted sulphuric acid of Mr. Clodd,
are guesses in the air, and Mr. Clodd has made no experiment.&nbsp;
The possibility of plunging the hand, unhurt, in molten metal, is easily
accounted for, and is not to the point.&nbsp; In this difficulty Psychical
Research registers, and no more, the well-attested performances of D.
D. Home (entranced, like the Nistinares); the well observed and timed
<i>Miracle</i> <i>du</i> <i>Cierge</i> at Lourdes&mdash;Bernadette being
in an ecstatic condition; the Biblical story of Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego in the fiery furnace; the researches of Iamblichus; the case
of Madame Shchapoff, carefully reported, <a name="citation175"></a><a href="#footnote175">{175}</a>
and other examples.&nbsp; There is no harm in collecting examples, and
the question remains, are all those rites, from those of Virgil&rsquo;s
Hirpi to Bulgaria of to-day, based on some actual but obscure and scientifically
neglected fact in nature?&nbsp; At all events, for the Soranus-Feronia
rite philology only supplies her competing etymologies, folk-lore her
modern rural parallels, anthropology her savage examples, psychical
research her &lsquo;cases&rsquo; at first-hand.&nbsp; Anthropology had
neglected the collection of these, perhaps because the Fire-walk is
&lsquo;impossible.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>THE ORIGIN OF DEATH</h2>
<h3>Yama</h3>
<p>This excursus on &lsquo;The Fire-walk&rsquo; has been introduced,
as an occasion arose, less because of controversy about a neglected
theme than for the purpose of giving something positive in a controversial
treatise.&nbsp; For the same reason I take advantage of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
remarks on Yama, &lsquo;the first who died,&rsquo; to offer a set of
notes on myths of the Origin of Death.&nbsp; Yama, in our author&rsquo;s
opinion, is &lsquo;the setting sun&rsquo; (i. 45; ii. 563).&nbsp; Agni
(Fire) is &lsquo;the first who was born;&rsquo; as the other twin, Yama,
he was also the first who died (ii. 568).&nbsp; As &lsquo;the setting
sun he was the first instance of death.&rsquo;&nbsp; Kuhn and others,
judging from a passage in the <i>Atharva</i> <i>Veda</i> (xviii. 3,
13), have, however, inferred that Yama &lsquo;was really a human being
and the first of mortals.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is described in the <i>Atharva</i>
as &lsquo;the gatherer of men, who died the first of mortals, who went
forward the first to that world.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the <i>Atharva</i>
we read of &lsquo;reverence to Yama, to Death, who first approached
the precipice, finding out the path for many.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The
myth of Yama is perfectly intelligible, if we trace its roots back to
the sun of evening&rsquo; (ii. 573).&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller then
proposes on this head &lsquo;to consult the traditions of real <i>Naturv&ouml;lker&rsquo;</i>
(savages).&nbsp; The Harvey Islanders speak of dying as &lsquo;following
the sun&rsquo;s track.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Maoris talk of &lsquo;going
down with the sun&rsquo; (ii. 574).&nbsp; No more is said here about
savage myths of &lsquo;the first who died.&rsquo;&nbsp; I therefore
offer some additions to the two instances in which savages use a poetical
phrase connecting the sun&rsquo;s decline with man&rsquo;s death.</p>
<h3>The Origin of Death</h3>
<p>Civilised man in a scientific age would never invent a myth to account
for &lsquo;God&rsquo;s great ordinance of death.&rsquo;&nbsp; He regards
it as a fact, obvious and necessarily universal; but his own children
have not attained to his belief in death.&nbsp; The certainty and universality
of death do not enter into the thoughts of our little ones.</p>
<blockquote><p>For in the thought of immortality<br />
Do children play about the flowery meads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, there are still many childlike tribes of men who practically
disbelieve in death.&nbsp; To them death is always a surprise and an
accident&mdash;an unnecessary, irrelevant intrusion on the living world.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Natural deaths are by many tribes regarded as supernatural,&rsquo;
says Dr. Tylor.&nbsp; These tribes have no conception of death as the
inevitable, eventual obstruction and cessation of the powers of the
bodily machine; the stopping of the pulses and processes of life by
violence or decay or disease.&nbsp; To persons who regard Death thus,
<i>his</i> intrusion into the world (for Death, of course, is thought
to be a person) stands in great need of explanation.&nbsp; That explanation,
as usual, is given in myths.</p>
<h3>Death, regarded as Unnatural</h3>
<p>But before studying these widely different myths, let us first establish
the fact that death really is regarded as something non-natural and
intrusive.&nbsp; The modern savage readily believes in and accounts
in a scientific way for <i>violent</i> deaths.&nbsp; The spear or club
breaks or crushes a hole in a man, and his soul flies out.&nbsp; But
the deaths he disbelieves in are <i>natural</i> deaths.&nbsp; These
he is obliged to explain as produced by some supernatural cause, generally
the action of malevolent spirits impelled by witches.&nbsp; Thus the
savage holds that, violence apart and the action of witches apart, man
would even now be immortal.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are rude races of Australia
and South America,&rsquo; writes Dr. Tylor, <a name="citation178"></a><a href="#footnote178">{178}</a>
&lsquo;whose intense belief in witchcraft has led them to declare that
if men were never bewitched, and never killed by violence, <i>they</i>
<i>would</i> <i>never</i> <i>die</i> <i>at</i> <i>all</i>.&nbsp; Like
the Australians, the Africans will inquire of their dead &ldquo;what
sorcerer slew them by his wicked arts.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The
natives,&rsquo; says Sir George Grey, speaking of the Australians, &lsquo;do
not believe that there is such a thing as death from natural causes.&rsquo;&nbsp;
On the death of an Australian native from disease, a kind of magical
coroner&rsquo;s inquest is held by the conjurers of the tribe, and the
direction in which the wizard lives who slew the dead man is ascertained
by the movements of worms and insects.&nbsp; The process is described
at full length by Mr. Brough Smyth in his <i>Aborigines</i> <i>of</i>
<i>Victoria</i> (i. 98-102).&nbsp; Turning from Australia to Hindustan,
we find that the Puwarrees (according to Heber&rsquo;s narrative) attribute
all natural deaths to a supernatural cause&mdash;namely, witchcraft.&nbsp;
That is, the Puwarrees do not yet believe in the universality and necessity
of Death.&nbsp; He is an intruder brought by magic arts into our living
world.&nbsp; Again, in his <i>Ethnology</i> <i>of</i> <i>Bengal</i>
(pp. 199, 200), Dalton tells us that the Hos (an aboriginal non-Aryan
race) are of the same opinion as the Puwarrees.&nbsp; &lsquo;They hold
that all disease in men or animals is attributable to one of two causes:
the wrath of some evil spirit or the spell of some witch or sorcerer.&nbsp;
These superstitions are common to all classes of the population of this
province.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the New Hebrides disease and death are caused,
as Mr. Codrington found, by <i>tamates</i>, or ghosts. <a name="citation179"></a><a href="#footnote179">{179}</a>&nbsp;
In New Caledonia, according to Erskine, death is the result of witchcraft
practised by members of a hostile tribe, for who would be so wicked
as to bewitch his fellow-tribesman?&nbsp; The Andaman Islanders attribute
all natural deaths to the supernatural influence of <i>e</i> <i>rem</i>
<i>chaugala</i>, or to <i>jurn</i>-<i>win</i>, two spirits of the jungle
and the sea.&nbsp; The death is avenged by the nearest relation of the
deceased, who shoots arrows at the invisible enemy.&nbsp; The negroes
of Central Africa entertain precisely similar ideas about the non-naturalness
of death.&nbsp; Mr. Duff Macdonald, in <i>Africana</i>, writes: &lsquo;Every
man who dies what we call a natural death is really killed by witches.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It is a far cry from the Blantyre Mission in Africa to the Eskimo of
the frozen North; but so uniform is human nature in the lower races
that the Eskimo precisely agree, as far as theories of death go, with
the Africans, the aborigines of India, the Andaman Islanders, the Australians,
and the rest.&nbsp; Dr. Rink <a name="citation180a"></a><a href="#footnote180a">{180a}</a>
found that &lsquo;sickness or death coming about in an accidental manner
was always attributed to witchcraft, and it remains a question whether
death on the whole was not originally accounted for as resulting from
magic.&rsquo;&nbsp; P&egrave;re Paul le Jeune, writing from Quebec in
1637, says of the Red Men: &lsquo;Je n&rsquo;en voy mourir quasi aucun,
qui ne pense estre ensorcel&eacute;.&rsquo; <a name="citation180b"></a><a href="#footnote180b">{180b}</a>&nbsp;
It is needless to show how these ideas survived into civilisation.&nbsp;
Bishop Jewell, denouncing witches before Queen Elizabeth, was, so far,
mentally on a level with the Eskimo and the Australian.&nbsp; The familiar
and voluminous records of trials for witchcraft, whether at Salem or
at Edinburgh, prove that all abnormal and unwonted deaths and diseases,
in animals or in men, were explained by our ancestors as the results
of supernatural mischief.</p>
<p>It has been made plain (and the proof might be enlarged to any extent)
that the savage does not regard death as &lsquo;God&rsquo;s great ordinance,&rsquo;
universal and inevitable and natural.&nbsp; But, being curious and inquisitive,
he cannot help asking himself, &lsquo;How did this terrible invader
first enter a world where he now appears so often?&rsquo;&nbsp; This
is, properly speaking, a scientific question; but the savage answers
it, not by collecting facts and generalising from them, but by inventing
a myth.&nbsp; That is his invariable habit.&nbsp; Does he want to know
why this tree has red berries, why that animal has brown stripes, why
this bird utters its peculiar cry, where fire came from, why a constellation
is grouped in one way or another, why his race of men differs from the
whites&mdash;in all these, and in all other intellectual perplexities,
the savage invents a story to solve the problem.&nbsp; Stories about
the Origin of Death are, therefore, among the commonest fruits of the
savage imagination.&nbsp; As those legends have been produced to meet
the same want by persons in a very similar mental condition, it inevitably
follows that they all resemble each other with considerable closeness.&nbsp;
We need not conclude that all the myths we are about to examine came
from a single original source, or were handed about&mdash;with flint
arrow-heads, seeds, shells, beads, and weapons&mdash;in the course of
savage commerce.&nbsp; Borrowing of this sort may&mdash;or, rather,
must&mdash;explain many difficulties as to the diffusion of some myths.&nbsp;
But the myths with which we are concerned now, the myths of the Origin
of Death, might easily have been separately developed by simple and
ignorant men seeking to discover an answer to the same problem.</p>
<h3>Why Men are Mortal</h3>
<p>The myths of the Origin of Death fall into a few categories.&nbsp;
In many legends of the lower races men are said to have become subject
to mortality because they infringed some mystic prohibition or <i>taboo</i>
of the sort which is common among untutored peoples.&nbsp; The apparently
untrammelled Polynesian, or Australian, or African, is really the slave
of countless traditions, which forbid him to eat this object or to touch
that, or to speak to such and such a person, or to utter this or that
word.&nbsp; Races in this curious state of ceremonial subjection often
account for death as the punishment imposed for breaking some <i>taboo</i>.&nbsp;
In other cases, death is said to have been caused by a sin of omission,
not of commission.&nbsp; People who have a complicated and minute ritual
(like so many of the lower races) persuade themselves that Death burst
on the world when some passage of the ritual was first omitted, or when
some custom was first infringed.&nbsp; Yet again, Death is fabled to
have first claimed us for his victims in consequence of the erroneous
delivery of a favourable message from some powerful supernatural being,
or because of the failure of some enterprise which would have resulted
in the overthrow of Death, or by virtue of a pact or covenant between
Death and the gods.&nbsp; Thus it will be seen that death is often (though
by no means invariably) the penalty of infringing a command, or of indulging
in a culpable curiosity.&nbsp; But there are cases, as we shall see,
in which death, as a tolerably general law, follows on a mere accident.&nbsp;
Some one is accidentally killed, and this &lsquo;gives Death a lead&rsquo;
(as they say in the hunting-field) over the fence which had hitherto
severed him from the world of living men.&nbsp; It is to be observed
in this connection that the first of men who died is usually regarded
as the discoverer of a hitherto &lsquo;unknown country,&rsquo; the land
beyond the grave, to which all future men must follow him.&nbsp; Bin
dir Woor, among the Australians, was the first man who suffered death,
and he (like Yama in the Vedic myth) became the Columbus of the new
world of the dead.</p>
<h3>Savage Death-Myths</h3>
<p>Let us now examine in detail a few of the savage stories of the Origin
of Death.&nbsp; That told by the Australians may be regarded with suspicion,
as a refraction from a careless hearing of the narrative in Genesis.&nbsp;
The legend printed by Mr. Brough Smyth <a name="citation183a"></a><a href="#footnote183a">{183a}</a>
was told to Mr. Bulwer by &lsquo;a black fellow far from sharp,&rsquo;
and this black fellow may conceivably have distorted what his tribe
had heard from a missionary.&nbsp; This sort of refraction is not uncommon,
and we must always guard ourselves against being deceived by a savage
corruption of a Biblical narrative.&nbsp; Here is the myth, such as
it is:&mdash;&lsquo;The first created man and woman were told&rsquo;
(by whom we do not learn) &lsquo;not to go near a certain tree in which
a bat lived.&nbsp; The bat was not to be disturbed.&nbsp; One day, however,
the woman was gathering firewood, and she went near the tree.&nbsp;
The bat flew away, and after that came Death.&rsquo;&nbsp; More evidently
genuine is the following legend of how Death &lsquo;got a lead&rsquo;
into the Australian world.&nbsp; &lsquo;The child of the first man was
wounded.&nbsp; If his parents could heal him, Death would never enter
the world.&nbsp; They failed.&nbsp; Death came.&rsquo;&nbsp; The wound
in this legend was inflicted by a supernatural being.&nbsp; Here Death
acts on the principle <i>ce</i> <i>n&rsquo;est</i> <i>que</i> <i>le</i>
<i>premier</i> <i>pas</i> <i>qui</i> <i>co&ucirc;te</i>, and the <i>premier</i>
<i>pas</i> was made easy for him.&nbsp; We may continue to examine the
stories which account for death as the result of breaking a <i>taboo</i>.&nbsp;
The Ningphos of Bengal say they were originally immortal. <a name="citation183b"></a><a href="#footnote183b">{183b}</a>&nbsp;
They were forbidden to bathe in a certain pool of water.&nbsp; Some
one, greatly daring, bathed, and ever since Ningphos have been subject
to death.&nbsp; The infringement, not of a <i>taboo</i>, but of a custom,
caused death in one of the many Melanesian myths on this subject.&nbsp;
Men and women had been practically deathless because they cast their
old skins at certain intervals; but a grandmother had a favourite grandchild
who failed to recognise her when she appeared as a young woman in her
new skin.&nbsp; With fatal good-nature the grandmother put on her old
skin again, and instantly men lost the art of skin-shifting, and Death
finally seized them. <a name="citation184"></a><a href="#footnote184">{184}</a></p>
<h3>The Greek Myth</h3>
<p>The Greek myth of the Origin of Death is the most important of those
which turn on the breaking of a prohibition.&nbsp; The story has unfortunately
become greatly confused in the various poetical forms which have reached
us.&nbsp; As far as can be ascertained, death was regarded in one early
Greek myth as the punishment of indulgence in forbidden curiosity.&nbsp;
Men appear to have been free from death before the quarrel between Zeus
and Prometheus.&nbsp; In consequence of this quarrel Heph&aelig;stus
fashioned a woman out of earth and water, and gave her to Epimetheus,
the brother of the Titan.&nbsp; Prometheus had forbidden his brother
to accept any gift from the gods, but the bride was welcomed nevertheless.&nbsp;
She brought her tabooed coffer: this was opened; and men&mdash;who,
according to Hesiod, had hitherto lived exempt from &lsquo;maladies
that bring down Fate&rsquo;&mdash;were overwhelmed with the &lsquo;diseases
that stalk abroad by night and day.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, in Hesiod (<i>Works</i>
<i>and</i> <i>Days</i>, 70-100) there is nothing said about unholy curiosity.&nbsp;
Pandora simply opened her casket and scattered its fatal contents.&nbsp;
But Philodemus assures us that, according to a variant of the myth,
it was Epimetheus who opened the forbidden coffer, whence came Death.</p>
<p>Leaving the myths which turn on the breaking of a <i>taboo</i>, and
reserving for consideration the New Zealand story, in which the Origin
of Death is the neglect of a ritual process, let us look at some African
myths of the Origin of Death.&nbsp; It is to be observed that in these
(as in all the myths of the most backward races) many of the characters
are not gods, but animals.</p>
<p>The Bushman story lacks the beginning.&nbsp; The mother of the little
Hare was lying dead, but we do not know how she came to die.&nbsp; The
Moon then struck the little Hare on the lip, cutting it open, and saying,
&lsquo;Cry loudly, for your mother will not return, as <i>I</i> do,
but is quite dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; In another version the Moon promises
that the old Hare shall return to life, but the little Hare is sceptical,
and is hit in the mouth as before.&nbsp; The Hottentot myth makes the
Moon send the Hare to men with the message that they will revive as
he (the Moon) does.&nbsp; But the Hare &lsquo;loses his memory as he
runs&rsquo; (to quote the French proverb, which may be based on a form
of this very tale), and the messenger brings the tidings that men shall
surely die and never revive.&nbsp; The angry Moon then burns a hole
in the Hare&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; In yet another Hottentot version the
Hare&rsquo;s failure to deliver the message correctly caused the death
of the Moon&rsquo;s mother (Bleek, <i>Bushman</i> <i>Folklore</i>).
<a name="citation185"></a><a href="#footnote185">{185}</a>&nbsp; Compare
Sir James Alexander&rsquo;s <i>Expedition</i>, ii. 250, where the Namaquas
tell this tale.&nbsp; The Fijians say that the Moon wished men to die
and be born again, like herself.&nbsp; The Rat said, &lsquo;No, let
them die, like rats;&rsquo; and they do. <a name="citation186"></a><a href="#footnote186">{186}</a></p>
<h3>The Serpent</h3>
<p>In this last variant we have death as the result of a failure or
transgression.&nbsp; Among the more backward natives of South India
(Lewin&rsquo;s <i>Wild</i> <i>Races</i> <i>of</i> <i>South</i> <i>India</i>)
the serpent is concerned, in a suspicious way, with the Origin of Death.&nbsp;
The following legend might so easily arise from a confused understanding
of the Mohammedan or Biblical narrative that it is of little value for
our purpose.&nbsp; At the same time, even if it is only an adaptation,
it shows the characteristics of the adapting mind:&mdash;God had made
the world, trees, and reptiles, and then set to work to make man out
of clay.&nbsp; A serpent came and devoured the still inanimate clay
images while God slept.&nbsp; The serpent still comes and bites us all,
and the end is death.&nbsp; If God never slept, there would be no death.&nbsp;
The snake carries us off while God is asleep.&nbsp; But the oddest part
of this myth remains.&nbsp; Not being able always to keep awake, God
made a dog to drive away the snake by barking.&nbsp; And that is why
dogs always howl when men are at the point of death.&nbsp; Here we have
our own rural superstition about howling dogs twisted into a South Indian
myth of the Origin of Death.&nbsp; The introduction of Death by a pure
accident recurs in a myth of Central Africa reported by Mr. Duff Macdonald.&nbsp;
There was a time when the man blessed by Sancho Panza had not yet &lsquo;invented
sleep.&rsquo;&nbsp; A woman it was who came and offered to instruct
two men in the still novel art of sleeping.&nbsp; &lsquo;She held the
nostrils of one, and he never awoke at all,&rsquo; and since then the
art of dying has been facile.</p>
<h3>Dualistic Myths</h3>
<p>A not unnatural theory of the Origin of Death is illustrated by a
myth from Pentecost Island and a Red Indian myth.&nbsp; In the legends
of very many races we find the attempt to account for the Origin of
Death and Evil by a simple dualistic myth.&nbsp; There were two brothers
who made things; one made things well, the other made them ill.&nbsp;
In Pentecost Island it was Tagar who made things well, and he appointed
that men should die for five days only, and live again.&nbsp; But the
malevolent Suque caused men &lsquo;to die right out.&rsquo; <a name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187">{187}</a>&nbsp;
The Red Indian legend of the same character is printed in the <i>Annual</i>
<i>Report</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Bureau</i> <i>of</i> <i>Ethnology</i>
(1879-80), p. 45.&nbsp; The younger of the Cin-au-av brothers, who were
wolves, said, &lsquo;When a man dies, send him back in the morning and
let all his friends rejoice.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Not so,&rsquo; said
the elder; &lsquo;the dead shall return no more.&rsquo;&nbsp; So the
younger brother slew the child of the elder, and this was the beginning
of death.</p>
<h3>Economic Myth</h3>
<p>There is another and a very quaint myth of the Origin of Death in
Banks Island.&nbsp; At first, in Banks Island, as elsewhere, men were
immortal.&nbsp; The economical results were just what might have been
expected.&nbsp; Property became concentrated in the hands of the few&mdash;that
is, of the first generations&mdash;while all the younger people were
practically paupers.&nbsp; To heal the disastrous social malady, Qat
(the maker of things, who was more or less a spider) sent for Mate&mdash;that
is, Death.&nbsp; Death lived near a volcanic crater of a mountain, where
there is now a by-way into Hades&mdash;or Panoi, as the Melanesians
call it.&nbsp; Death came, and went through the empty forms of a funeral
feast for himself.&nbsp; Tangaro the Fool was sent to watch Mate, and
to see by what way he returned to Hades, that men might avoid that path
in future.&nbsp; Now when Mate fled to his own place, this great fool
Tangaro noticed the path, but forgot which it was, and pointed it out
to men under the impression that it was the road to the <i>upper</i>,
not to the <i>under</i>, world.&nbsp; Ever since that day men have been
constrained to follow Mate&rsquo;s path to Panoi and the dead. <a name="citation188"></a><a href="#footnote188">{188}</a>&nbsp;
Another myth is somewhat different, but, like this one, attributes death
to the imbecility of Tangaro the Fool.</p>
<h3>Maui and Yama</h3>
<p>The New Zealand myth of the Origin of Death is pretty well known,
as Dr. Tylor has seen in it the remnants of a solar myth, and has given
it a &lsquo;solar&rsquo; explanation.&nbsp; It is an audacious thing
to differ from so cautious and learned an anthropologist as Dr. Tylor,
but I venture to give my reasons for dissenting in this case from the
view of the author of <i>Primitive</i> <i>Culture</i> (i. 335).&nbsp;
Maui is the great hero of Maori mythology.&nbsp; He was not precisely
a god, still less was he one of the early elemental gods, yet we can
scarcely regard him as a man.&nbsp; He rather answers to one of the
race of Titans, and especially to Prometheus, the son of a Titan.&nbsp;
Maui was prematurely born, and his mother thought the child would be
no credit to her already numerous and promising family.&nbsp; She therefore
(as native women too often did in the South-Sea Islands) tied him up
in her long tresses and tossed him out to sea.&nbsp; The gales brought
him back to shore: one of his grandparents carried him home, and he
became much the most illustrious and successful of his household.&nbsp;
So far Maui had the luck which so commonly attends the youngest and
least-considered child in folklore and mythology.&nbsp; This feature
in his myth may be a result of the very widespread custom of <i>j&uuml;ngsten</i>
<i>Recht</i> (Borough English), by which the youngest child is heir
at least of the family hearth.&nbsp; Now, unluckily, at the baptism
of Maui (for a pagan form of baptism is a Maori ceremony) his father
omitted some of the Karakias, or ritual utterances proper to be used
on such occasions.&nbsp; This was the fatal original mistake whence
came man&rsquo;s liability to death, for hitherto men had been immortal.&nbsp;
So far, what is there &lsquo;solar&rsquo; about Maui?&nbsp; Who are
the sun&rsquo;s brethren?&mdash;and Maui had many.&nbsp; How could the
sun catch the sun in a snare, and beat him so as to make him lame?&nbsp;
This was one of Maui&rsquo;s feats, for he meant to prevent the sun
from running too fast through the sky.&nbsp; Maui brought fire, indeed,
from the under-world, as Prometheus stole it from the upper-world; but
many men and many beasts do as much as the myths of the world, and it
is hard to see how the exploit gives Maui &lsquo;a solar character.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Maui invented barbs for hooks, and other appurtenances of early civilisation,
with which the sun has no more to do than with patent safety-matches.&nbsp;
His last feat was to attempt to secure human immortality for ever.&nbsp;
There are various legends on this subject.</p>
<h3>Maui Myths</h3>
<p>Some say Maui noticed that the sun and moon rose again from their
daily death, by virtue of a fountain in Hades (Hine-nui-te-po) where
they bathed.&nbsp; Others say he wished to kill Hine-nui-te-po (conceived
of as a woman) and to carry off her heart.&nbsp; Whatever the reason,
Maui was to be swallowed up in the giant frame of Hades, or Night, and,
if he escaped alive, Death would never have power over men.&nbsp; He
made the desperate adventure, and would have succeeded but for the folly
of one of the birds which accompanied him.&nbsp; This little bird, which
sings at sunset, burst out laughing inopportunely, wakened Hine-nui-te-po,
and she crushed to death Maui and all hopes of earthly immortality.&nbsp;
Had he only come forth alive, men would have been deathless.&nbsp; Now,
except that the bird which laughed sings at sunset, what is there &lsquo;solar&rsquo;
in all this?&nbsp; <i>The</i> <i>sun</i> <i>does</i> <i>daily</i> <i>what</i>
<i>Maui</i> <i>failed</i> <i>to</i> <i>do</i>, <a name="citation190a"></a><a href="#footnote190a">{190a}</a>
passes through darkness and death back into light and life.&nbsp; Not
only does the sun daily succeed where Maui failed, but it was his observation
of this fact which encouraged Maui to risk the adventure.&nbsp; If Maui
were the sun, we should all be immortal, for Maui&rsquo;s ordeal is
daily achieved by the sun.&nbsp; But Dr. Tylor says: <a name="citation190b"></a><a href="#footnote190b">{190b}</a>
&lsquo;It is seldom that solar characteristics are more distinctly marked
in the several details of a myth than they are here.&rsquo;&nbsp; To
us the characteristics seem to be precisely the reverse of solar.&nbsp;
Throughout the cycle of Maui he is constantly set in direct opposition
to the sun, and the very point of the final legend is that what the
sun could do Maui could not.&nbsp; Literally the one common point between
Maui and the sun is that the little bird, the <i>tiwakawaka</i>, which
sings at the daily death of day, sang at the eternal death of Maui.</p>
<p>Without pausing to consider the Tongan myth of the Origin of Death,
we may go on to investigate the legends of the Aryan races.&nbsp; According
to the <i>Satapatha</i> <i>Brahmana</i>, Death was made, like the gods
and other creatures, by a being named Prajapati.&nbsp; Now of Prajapati,
half was mortal, half was immortal.&nbsp; With his mortal half he feared
Death, and concealed himself from Death in earth and water.&nbsp; Death
said to the gods, &lsquo;What hath become of him who created us?&rsquo;&nbsp;
They answered, &lsquo;Fearing thee, hath he entered the earth.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The gods and Prajapati now freed themselves from the dominion of Death
by celebrating an enormous number of sacrifices.&nbsp; Death was chagrined
by their escape from the &lsquo;nets and clubs&rsquo; which he carries
in the <i>Aitareya</i> <i>Brahmana</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;As you have escaped
me, so will men also escape,&rsquo; he grumbled.&nbsp; The gods appeased
him by the promise that, <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>body</i>, no man henceforth
for ever should evade Death.&nbsp; &lsquo;Every one who is to become
immortal shall do so by first parting with his body.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Yama</h3>
<p>Among the Aryans of India, as we have already seen, Death has a protomartyr,
Tama, &lsquo;the first of men who reached the river, spying out a path
for many.&rsquo;&nbsp; In spying the path Yama corresponds to Tangaro
the Fool, in the myth of the Solomon Islands.&nbsp; But Yama is not
regarded as a maleficent being, like Tangaro.&nbsp; The <i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i>
(x. 14) speaks of him as &lsquo;King Yama, who departed to the mighty
streams and sought out a road for many;&rsquo; and again, the <i>Atharva</i>
<i>Veda</i> names him &lsquo;the first of men who died, and the first
who departed to the celestial world.&rsquo;&nbsp; With him the Blessed
Fathers dwell for ever in happiness.&nbsp; Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, as we
said, takes Yama to be &lsquo;a character suggested by the setting sun&rsquo;&mdash;a
claim which is also put forward, as we have seen, for the Maori hero
Maui.&nbsp; It is Yama, according to the <i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i>, who
sends the birds&mdash;a pigeon is one of his messengers (compare the
White Bird of the Oxenhams)&mdash;as warnings of approaching death.&nbsp;
Among the Iranian race, Yima appears to have been the counterpart of
the Vedic Yama.&nbsp; He is now King of the Blessed; originally he was
the first of men over whom Death won his earliest victory.</p>
<h3>Inferences</h3>
<p>That Yama is mixed up with the sun, in the <i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i>,
seems certain enough.&nbsp; Most phenomena, most gods, shade into each
other in the Vedic hymns.&nbsp; But it is plain that the conception
of a &lsquo;first man who died&rsquo; is as common to many races as
it is natural.&nbsp; Death was regarded as unnatural, yet here it is
among us.&nbsp; How did it come?&nbsp; By somebody dying first, and
establishing a bad precedent.&nbsp; But need that somebody have been
originally the sun, as Mr. Max M&uuml;ller and Dr. Tylor think in the
cases of Yama and Maui?&nbsp; This is a point on which we may remain
in doubt, for death in itself was certain to challenge inquiry among
savage philosophers, and to be explained by a human rather than by a
solar myth.&nbsp; Human, too, rather than a result of &lsquo;disease
of language&rsquo; is, probably, the myth of the Fire-stealer.</p>
<h3>The Stealing of Fire</h3>
<p>The world-wide myth explaining how man first became possessed of
fire&mdash;namely, by <i>stealing</i> it&mdash;might well serve as a
touchstone of the philological and anthropological methods.&nbsp; To
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller the interest of the story will certainly consist
in discovering connections between Greek and Sanskrit names of fire-gods
and of fire bringing heroes.&nbsp; He will not compare the fire-myths
of other races all over the world, nor will he even try to explain why&mdash;in
almost all of these myths we find a thief of fire, a Fire-stealer.&nbsp;
This does not seem satisfactory to the anthropologist, whose first curiosity
is to know why fire is everywhere said to have been obtained for men
by sly theft or &lsquo;flat burglary.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course it is obvious
that a myth found in Australia and America cannot possibly be the result
of disease of Aryan languages not spoken in those two continents.&nbsp;
The myth of fire-stealing must necessarily have some other origin.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Fire Totems&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, after a treatise on Agni and other fire-gods,
consecrates two pages to &lsquo;Fire Totems.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;If
we are assured that there are some dark points left, and that these
might be illustrated and rendered more intelligible by what are called
fire totems among the Red Indians of North America, let us have as much
light as we can get&rsquo; (ii. 804).&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I never heard
of fire totems before.&nbsp; Probably some one has been writing about
them, somewhere, unless we owe them to Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s own
researches.&nbsp; Of course, he cites no authority for his fire totems.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The fire totem, we are told, would thus naturally have become
the god of the Indians.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;We are told&rsquo;&mdash;where,
and by whom?&nbsp; Not a hint is given on the subject, so we must leave
the doctrine of fire totems to its mysterious discoverer.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
others prefer to call Prometheus a fire totem, no one would object,
if only it would help us to a better understanding of Prometheus&rsquo;
(ii. 810).&nbsp; Who are the &lsquo;others&rsquo; who speak of a Greek
&lsquo;culture-hero&rsquo; by the impossibly fantastic name of &lsquo;a
fire totem&rsquo;?</p>
<h3>Prometheus</h3>
<p>Mr. Max M&uuml;ller &lsquo;follows Kuhn&rsquo; in his explanation
of Prometheus, the Fire-stealer, but he does not follow him all the
way.&nbsp; Kuhn tried to account for the myth that Prometheus <i>stole</i>
fire, and Mr. Max M&uuml;ller does not try. <a name="citation194"></a><a href="#footnote194">{194}</a>&nbsp;
Kuhn connects <i>Prometheus</i> with the Sanskrit <i>pramantha</i>,
the stick used in producing fire by drilling a pointed into a flat piece
of wood.&nbsp; The Greeks, of course, made Prometheus mean &lsquo;foresighted,&rsquo;
<i>providens</i>; but let it be granted that the Germans know better.&nbsp;
<i>Pramantha</i> next is associated with the verb <i>mathnami</i>, &lsquo;to
rub <i>or</i> grind;&rsquo; and that, again, with Greek &mu;&alpha;&nu;&theta;&alpha;&nu;&omega;,
&lsquo;to learn.&rsquo;&nbsp; We too talk of a student as a &lsquo;grinder,&rsquo;
by a coincidence.&nbsp; The root <i>manth</i> likewise means &lsquo;to
rob;&rsquo; and we can see in English how a fire-stick, a &lsquo;fire-rubber,&rsquo;
might become a &lsquo;fire-robber,&rsquo; a stealer of fire.&nbsp; A
somewhat similar confusion in old Aryan languages converted the fire-stick
into a person, the thief of fire, Prometheus; while a Greek misunderstanding
gave to Prometheus (<i>pramantha</i>, &lsquo;fire-stick&rsquo;) the
meaning of &lsquo;foresighted,&rsquo; with the word for prudent foresight,
&pi;&rho;&omicron;&mu;&eta;&theta;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;.&nbsp; This,
roughly stated, is the view of Kuhn. <a name="citation195a"></a><a href="#footnote195a">{195a}</a>&nbsp;
Mr. Max M&uuml;ller concludes that Prometheus, the producer of fire,
is also the fire-god, a representative of Agni, and necessarily &lsquo;of
the inevitable Dawn&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;of Agni as the <i>deus</i> <i>matutinus</i>,
a frequent character of the Vedic Agni, the <i>Agni</i> <i>aushasa</i>,
or the daybreak&rsquo; (ii. 813).</p>
<p>But Mr. Max M&uuml;ller does not say one word about Prometheus as
the Fire-stealer.&nbsp; Now, that he <i>stole</i> fire is of the essence
of his myth; and this myth of the original procuring of fire by theft
occurs all over the world.&nbsp; As Australian and American savages
cannot conceivably have derived the myth of fire-stealing from the root
<i>manth</i> and its double sense of stealing and rubbing, there must
be some other explanation.&nbsp; But this fact could not occur to comparative
mythologists who did not compare, probably did not even know, similar
myths wherever found.</p>
<h3>Savage Myths of Fire-stealing</h3>
<p>In <i>La</i> <i>Mythologie</i> (pp. 185-195) I have put together
a small collection of savage myths of the theft of fire. <a name="citation195b"></a><a href="#footnote195b">{195b}</a>&nbsp;
Our text is the line of Hesiod (<i>Theogony</i>, 566), &lsquo;Prometheus
<i>stole</i> the far-seen ray of unwearied fire in a hollow stalk of
fennel.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same stalk is still used in the Greek isles
for carrying fire, as it was of old&mdash;whence no doubt this feature
of the myth. <a name="citation195c"></a><a href="#footnote195c">{195c}</a>&nbsp;
How did Prometheus steal fire?&nbsp; Some say from the altar of Zeus,
others that he lit his rod at the sun. <a name="citation196a"></a><a href="#footnote196a">{196a}</a>&nbsp;
The Australians have the same fable; fire was obtained by a black fellow
who climbed by a rope to the sun.&nbsp; Again, in Australia fire was
the possession of two women alone.&nbsp; A man induced them to turn
their backs, and stole fire.&nbsp; A very curious version of the myth
occurs in an excellent book by Mrs. Langloh Parker. <a name="citation196b"></a><a href="#footnote196b">{196b}</a>&nbsp;
There was no fire when Rootoolgar, the crane, married Gooner, the kangaroo
rat.&nbsp; Rootoolgar, idly rubbing two sticks together, discovered
the art of fire-making.&nbsp; &lsquo;This we will keep secret,&rsquo;
they said, &lsquo;from all the tribes.&rsquo;&nbsp; A fire-stick they
carried about in their <i>comebee</i>.&nbsp; The tribes of the Bush
discovered the secret, and the fire-stick was stolen by Reeargar, the
hawk.&nbsp; We shall be told, of course, that the hawk is the lightning,
or the Dawn.&nbsp; But in this savage Jungle Book all the characters
are animals, and Reeargar is no more the Dawn than is the kangaroo rat.&nbsp;
In savage myths animals, not men, play the leading <i>r&ocirc;les</i>,
and the fire-stealing bird or beast is found among many widely scattered
races.&nbsp; In Normandy the wren is the fire-bringer. <a name="citation196c"></a><a href="#footnote196c">{196c}</a>&nbsp;
A bird brings fire in the Andaman Isles. <a name="citation196d"></a><a href="#footnote196d">{196d}</a>&nbsp;
Among the Ahts a fish owned fire; other beasts stole it.&nbsp; The raven
hero of the Thlinkeets, Yehl, stole fire.&nbsp; Among the Cahrocs two
old women possessed it, and it was stolen by the coyote.&nbsp; Are these
theftuous birds and beasts to be explained as Fire-gods?&nbsp; Probably
not.&nbsp; Will any philologist aver that in Cahroc, Thlinkeet.&nbsp;
Australian, Andaman, and so forth, the word for &lsquo;rub&rsquo; resembled
the word for &lsquo;rob,&rsquo; and so produced by &lsquo;a disease
of language&rsquo; the myth of the Fire-stealer?</p>
<h3>Origin of the Myth of Fire-stealing</h3>
<p>The myth arose from the nature of savage ideas, not from unconscious
puns.&nbsp; Even in a race so civilised as the Homeric Greeks, to make
fire was no easy task.&nbsp; Homer speaks of a man, in a lonely upland
hut, who carefully keeps the embers alive, that he may not have to go
far afield in search of the seed of fire. <a name="citation197"></a><a href="#footnote197">{197}</a>&nbsp;
Obviously he had no ready means of striking a light.&nbsp; Suppose,
then, that an early savage loses his seed of fire.&nbsp; His nearest
neighbours, far enough off, may be hostile.&nbsp; If he wants fire,
as they will not give it, he must <i>steal</i> it, just as he must steal
a wife.&nbsp; People in this condition would readily believe, like the
Australian blacks, that the original discoverers or possessors of a
secret so valuable as fire would not give it away, that others who wanted
it would be obliged to get it by theft.&nbsp; In Greece, in a civilised
race, this very natural old idea survives, though fire is not the possession
of a crane, or of an old woman, but of the gods, and is stolen, not
by a hawk or a coyote, but by Prometheus, the culture-hero and demiurge.&nbsp;
Whether his name &lsquo;Foresighted&rsquo; is a mistaken folk-etymology
from the root <i>manth</i>, or not, we have, in the ancient inevitable
idea, that the original patentees of fire would not willingly part with
their treasure, the obvious origin of the myth of the Fire-stealer.&nbsp;
And this theory does not leave the analogous savage myths of fire-stealing
unexplained and out in the cold, as does the philological hypothesis.
<a name="citation198"></a><a href="#footnote198">{198}</a>&nbsp; In
this last instance, as in others, the origin of a world-wide myth is
found, not in a &lsquo;disease of language,&rsquo; but in a form of
thought still natural.&nbsp; If a foreign power wants what answers among
us to the exclusive possession of fire, or wants the secret of its rival&rsquo;s
new explosive, it has to <i>steal</i> it.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Here ends this &lsquo;Gentle and Joyous Passage of Arms.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I showed, first, why anthropological students of mythology, finding
the philological school occupying the ground, were obliged in England
to challenge Mr. Max M&uuml;ller.&nbsp; I then discoursed of some inconveniences
attending his method in controversy.&nbsp; Next, I gave a practical
example, the affair of Tuna and Daphne.&nbsp; This led to a comparison
of the philological and the anthropological ways of treating the Daphne
myth.&nbsp; The question of our allies then coming up, I stated my reasons
for regarding Prof. Tiele &lsquo;rather as an ally than an adversary,&rsquo;
the reason being his own statement.&nbsp; Presently, I replied to Prof.
Tiele&rsquo;s criticism of my treatment of the myth of Cronos.&nbsp;
After a skirmish on Italian fields, I gave my reasons for disagreeing
with Mr. Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s view of Mannhardt&rsquo;s position.&nbsp;
His theory of Demeter Erinnys was contrasted with that of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller.&nbsp;
Totemism occupied us next, and the views of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller and
Mr. J. G. Frazer were criticised.&nbsp; Then I defended anthropological
and criticised philological evidence.&nbsp; Our method of universal
comparison was next justified in the matter of Fetishism.&nbsp; The
Riddle Theory of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller was presently discussed.&nbsp;
Then followed a review of our contending methods in the explanation
of Artemis, of the Fire-walk, of Death Myths, and of the Fire-stealer.&nbsp;
Thus a number of points in mythological interpretation have been tested
on typical examples.</p>
<p>Much more might be said on a book of nearly 900 pages.&nbsp; Many
points might be taken, much praise (were mine worth anything) might
be given; but I have had but one object, to defend the method of anthropology
from a running or dropping fire of criticism which breaks out in many
points all along the line, through <i>Contributions</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i>
<i>Science</i> <i>of</i> <i>Mythology</i>.&nbsp; If my answer be desultory
and wandering, remember the sporadic sharpshooting of the adversary!&nbsp;
For adversary we must consider Mr. Max M&uuml;ller, so long as we use
different theories to different results.&nbsp; If I am right, if he
is wrong, in our attempts to untie this old Gordian knot, he loses little
indeed.&nbsp; That fame of his, the most steady and brilliant light
of all which crown the brows of contemporary scholars, is the well-earned
reward, not of mythological lore nor of cunning fence in controversy,
but of wide learning and exquisitely luminous style.</p>
<p>I trust that I have imputed no unfairness, made no charge of conscious
misrepresentation (to accidents of exposition we are all liable), have
struck no foul blow, hazarded no discourteous phrase.&nbsp; If I have
done so, I am thereby, even more than in my smattering of unscholarly
learning, an opponent more absolutely unworthy of the Right Hon. Professor
than I would fain believe myself.</p>
<h2>APPENDIX A: The Fire-walk in Spain</h2>
<p>One study occasionally illustrates another.&nbsp; In examining the
history of the Earl Marischal, who was exiled after the rising of 1715,
I found, in a letter of a correspondent of d&rsquo;Alembert, that the
Earl met a form of the fire-walk in Spain.&nbsp; There then existed
in the Peninsula a hereditary class of men who, by dint of &lsquo;charms&rsquo;
permitted by the Inquisition, could enter fire unharmed.&nbsp; The Earl
Marischal said that he would believe in their powers if he were allowed
first to light the fire, and then to look on.&nbsp; But the fire-walkers
would not gratify him, as not knowing what kind of fire a heretic might
kindle.</p>
<h2>APPENDIX B: Mr. Macdonell on Vedic Mythology</h2>
<p>Too late for use here came <i>Vedic</i> <i>Mythology</i>, from <i>Grundriss</i>
<i>der</i> <i>indo</i>-<i>arischen</i> <i>Philologie</i>, <a name="citation201"></a><a href="#footnote201">{201}</a>
by Mr. A. Macdonell, the representative of the historic house of Lochgarry.&nbsp;
This even a non-scholar can perceive to be a most careful and learned
work.&nbsp; As to philological &lsquo;equations&rsquo; between names
of Greek and Vedic gods, Mr. Macdonell writes: &lsquo;Dyaus=&Zeta;&epsilon;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
is the only one which can be said to be beyond the range of doubt.&rsquo;&nbsp;
As to the connection of Prometheus with Sanskrit Pramantha, he says:
&lsquo;&Pi;&rho;&omicron;&mu;&eta;&theta;&epsilon;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
has every appearance of being a purely Greek formation, while the Indian
verb <i>math</i>, to twirl, is found compounded only with <i>nis</i>,
never with <i>pra</i>, to express the art of producing fire by friction.&rsquo;&nbsp;
(See above, p. 194.)&nbsp; If Mr. Macdonell is right here, the Greek
myth of the fire-stealer cannot have arisen from &lsquo;a disease of
language.&rsquo;&nbsp; But scholars must be left to reconcile this last
typical example of their ceaseless differences in the matter of etymology
of names.</p>

The connection between the Moon and the Hare is also found in Sanskrit,
in Mexican, in some of the South Sea Islands, and in German and Buddhist
folklore.&nbsp; Probably what we call &lsquo;the Man in the Moon&rsquo;
seemed very like a hare to various races, roused their curiosity, and
provoked explanations in the shape of myths.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
